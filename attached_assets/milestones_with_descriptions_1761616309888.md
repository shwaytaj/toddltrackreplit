## 0-1 MONTHS

### GROSS MOTOR SKILLS

#### Lifts head briefly while lying on tummy

**About**

Around the 1-month mark, your baby might start to briefly lift their head when placed on their tummy. It's usually just a few seconds at a time—a little bob upward—but it's a big first step in building the neck and upper body strength they'll need for later milestones like rolling, sitting, and crawling. The baby crying out of discomfort during tummy time is absolutely normal, but do trust your gut and visit a GP or a PHN if you feel something is wrong.

**What to look for**
- Baby may turn their head side to side while on their tummy
- Head may lift slightly off the floor for a second or two—wobbly but determined
- You might see their arms starting to push a little too, though not strongly yet
- Brief periods of head elevation, usually 1-3 seconds
- Effort and engagement during tummy time, even if brief

**Why it matters**

This isn't just about neck muscles—it's about developing coordination, body awareness, and endurance. It also helps prevent flat spots on the back of their head from too much time lying on their back. Early neck strength is the foundation for all future gross motor development, from rolling to sitting to eventually walking.

#### Begins to loosen tight fists

**About**

Newborns are born with high flexor tone and a strong palmar grasp reflex, so those tight little fists are normal. Around 4 weeks (give or take), that reflex begins to ease and muscle tone starts to balance out. What this really means is your baby's hands will open more often, the thumb will separate from the palm, and the fingers will briefly splay or wiggle. This is the groundwork for everything that follows: reaching, grasping, bringing hands to mouth, and eventually holding toys.

**What to look for**
- Hands not always clenched. During calm, awake moments you'll see the hands open a bit—maybe 20–50% of the time—then close again
- Thumb coming out of the palm. Less "thumb-in" fisting, more open, relaxed hand
- Hands to midline or mouth. Briefly bringing hands together on the chest or toward the mouth, especially while settling
- Symmetry. Both hands loosening in a similar way (perfectly identical isn't required)
- Short "holds." Baby may lightly "catch" your finger or a soft cloth, then let go

**Why it matters**
- **Sensory learning:** Open hands let babies feel textures, temperature, and their own skin—huge for brain development
- **Self-soothing:** Hands to mouth is a powerful regulator
- **Motor foundation:** Looser hands precede purposeful grasping (around 3–4 months) and coordinated reaching (around 4 months)
- **Early screen for issues:** Persistent tight fisting or clear asymmetry can flag something worth checking early, when help is most effective

---

#### Moves both arms and legs

**About**

From birth, healthy newborns show spontaneous, random movements of all four limbs. These movements are reflexive and uncoordinated at first—jerky kicks, arm flails, and startles. Over the first month, you'll notice more frequent, smoother movements as the nervous system matures and muscle tone balances out. This is your baby learning about their body in space and building the foundation for purposeful movement.

**What to look for**
- Frequent spontaneous movements of arms and legs during awake time
- Symmetrical movement—both sides moving similarly (perfect symmetry not required)
- Increased smoothness over the first weeks
- Active movements during alert, content states
- Variety in movement patterns—stretching, kicking, reaching

**Why it matters**

Moving all limbs helps your baby develop body awareness, strengthen muscles, and wire the connections between brain and body. It's also an important health indicator—consistent asymmetry or lack of movement can signal issues that benefit from early intervention. These early movements lay the groundwork for reaching, rolling, crawling, and walking.

### COMMUNICATION

#### Alert to sounds

**About**

Babies are born with fully functioning hearing. From day one, they can detect sounds and will show clear responses—pausing, widening eyes, changing breathing, or turning toward familiar voices. The startle (Moro) reflex to sudden loud sounds is strongest in the first weeks. By 4–6 weeks, babies start to orient more purposefully toward sounds, especially human voices.

**What to look for**
- Pausing or stilling when a sound occurs
- Widening eyes or changing facial expression
- Startle response to sudden loud noises
- Calming to familiar voices, especially parent's voice
- Brief head or eye turn toward the sound source
- Different responses to different types of sounds (voices vs. background noise)

**Why it matters**

Responding to sounds is the foundation for language development. It tells you that your baby's hearing is working and that they're beginning to process the auditory world. Early detection of hearing issues is critical—the earlier hearing problems are identified, the better the outcomes for speech, language, and social development.

---

#### Makes throaty noises (gurgling)

**About**

In the first weeks, babies make reflexive sounds—cries, sighs, sneezes, hiccups. Around 3–6 weeks, you'll start hearing new sounds: soft gurgles, grunts, and coos produced in the back of the throat. These are your baby's first attempts at vocal play. They're experimenting with their voice box, breath control, and mouth movements—the building blocks of speech.

**What to look for**
- Soft vowel-like sounds: "uh," "eh," "ah"
- Gurgling or cooing sounds, especially when content
- Sounds made during alert, happy states
- Increasing variety of sounds over the first month
- Sounds directed at faces or in response to your voice

**Why it matters**

These early vocalizations are the beginning of language. Every coo and gurgle strengthens the muscles used for speech and helps your baby learn that making sounds gets a response. When you respond with your own sounds and words, you're teaching the back-and-forth rhythm of conversation—the foundation of all communication.

---

#### Recognizes your voice

**About**

From day one, babies are tuned to human voices, especially the familiar ones they heard in the womb. In the first weeks they'll quiet, brighten, or settle when they hear you. By 6–8 weeks many start "talking back" with coos, and by 3–4 months they actively seek your voice.

**What to look for**
- State change with your voice. Baby pauses, quiets, or perks up when you speak nearby, even if they can't see you
- Orientation. Brief head turn or eye shift toward the sound by around 3–4 months
- Face brightening. Widened eyes, stilling of the body, soft kicks, or a half-smile when you start talking or singing
- Vocal "answers." Little coos, sighs, or grunts after you speak, early turn-taking
- Preference. Calmer with you than with background chatter; favorite lullabies get faster smiles or quicker settling over time

**Why it matters**
- **Bonding and regulation:** Your voice is a built-in calmer and anchor in a noisy world
- **Language wiring:** Every chat builds sound mapping, rhythm, and attention, the scaffolding for words later
- **Social skills:** Turn-taking with sounds is the earliest "conversation"
- **Listening practice:** Locating and tracking a voice trains auditory attention

---

#### Startled by loud noises

**About**

The startle (Moro) reflex is built-in. A sudden loud sound can trigger a full-body "whoa": arms fling out, hands open, then arms fold back in, often with a quick cry. It's most obvious in the first weeks and gradually fades as the nervous system matures. Typical range: present from birth, strongest in the first 4–6 weeks, and usually integrates by 3–6 months. Preterm babies follow their corrected age timeline.

**What to look for**
- Classic pattern: Arms fly out and open, then return to the body; brief cry, quick recovery
- Blink/alerting: A clear blink or pause to a sharp clap or dropped book (not right next to the ear)
- Habituation: With the same sound repeated a few times, the reaction should shrink
- State matters: Bigger startles when baby is overtired, falling asleep, or just waking
- Symmetry: Both arms/legs move similarly. Perfect mirror image isn't required, but clear one-sidedness isn't typical
- Short and stimulus-linked: It happens right after the sound and lasts a second or two

**Why it matters**
- **Hearing check:** Startling to loud sounds tells you baby is detecting them
- **Brain development:** Over time the reflex quiets and is replaced by purposeful orienting (turning head toward sounds)
- **Self-regulation practice:** Recovering from small startles builds coping skills for bigger sensations later

---

#### Cries to communicate needs

**About**

Crying is a newborn's first language. From birth, it's how they say "I'm hungry," "I'm tired," "I'm overstimulated," or "Something hurts." There isn't a universal cry dictionary—each baby's signals are a little different—but patterns emerge fast when you watch and respond. Typical range: crying starts day one, often peaks around 6–8 weeks, then eases by 3–4 months as other signals (coos, smiles, more organized routines) kick in. Premature babies follow their corrected age timeline.

**What to look for**
- **Different "flavors" of cry:**
  - Hunger: rhythmic, builds steadily; rooting/hand-to-mouth, head turning
  - Tired/overstimulated: fuss → whining cry, rubbing eyes/ears, staring away, hiccups
  - Discomfort/gas: strained face, pulling legs up, grunty bursts
  - Pain/ill: sudden, sharp, higher-pitched; baby looks tense or inconsolable
- Body + face clues: color change, grimace, splayed fingers, arching, clenched fists
- Escalation curve: brief fuss → cry → wail if needs aren't met. Quicker escalation when overtired
- Consolability: settles with a consistent response (feeding, holding, swaddling, motion, sucking)
- Daily pattern: more crying late afternoon/evening is common ("witching hour")
- Your baby's signature: timing, pitch, and what soothes them—this is your playbook

**Why it matters**
- **Survival + attachment:** Your prompt, warm response teaches "When I signal, someone comes." That's secure bonding
- **Self-regulation:** Being soothed repeatedly helps wire the brain for calming down later
- **Communication foundation:** You learn their cues; they learn that signals have outcomes—step one toward back-and-forth interaction
- **Health check:** Changes in cry quality or consolability can flag illness or pain

---

### SOCIAL & EMOTIONAL

#### Getting to know you and beginning to bond

**About**

From birth, your baby is learning who you are. They track your face, settle to your voice and smell, and mold into your arms. In the first weeks, bonding is mostly about repeated, warm interactions—feeding, holding, soothing, skin-to-skin. Your baby can't "love" you yet in the adult sense, but they're building the neural pathways that wire trust, safety, and attachment. Every responsive interaction strengthens this foundation.

**What to look for**
- Calms when held or spoken to by primary caregivers
- Settles more quickly with familiar people
- Begins to track caregiver's face and voice
- Molds body to caregiver when held
- Shows early preference for primary caregiver's voice and smell
- Increasing alertness and focus during calm interactions

**Why it matters**

Secure attachment in infancy predicts better emotional regulation, social skills, and resilience throughout life. The brain is wiring trust and safety systems that shape how your child will relate to others forever. Responsive caregiving—meeting needs promptly and warmly—is the single most important ingredient in healthy development.

---

#### Cries 2-3 hours a day

**About**

Most healthy newborns have a daily fuss/cry window that grows through the first weeks, often peaking around 6–8 weeks, then easing by 3–4 months. Two to three hours total across the day—often stacked in the late afternoon/evening—is common. What this really means is: your baby's nervous system is still learning to process hunger, fatigue, gas, light, and noise. Crying is the outlet. A quick reference point: "colic" is typically defined by the rule of threes—more than 3 hours a day, 3 days a week, for 3 weeks or more, in an otherwise healthy baby.

**What to look for**
- Patterns: Does fussing cluster at certain times (usually late afternoon)? Track for 3–4 days and you'll see rhythms
- State change: Tired babies cry more. Watch wake windows: many newborns manage 45–90 minutes between sleeps
- Cues layered on the cry:
  - Hunger: rooting, hand-to-mouth, steady build
  - Overtired/overstimulated: glazed look, turning away, frantic movements
  - Gas/discomfort: face strain, knees up, grunty bursts
- Consolability: With the right response—feeding, holding, swaddling for sleep, motion, sucking—crying should reduce within minutes
- Escalation curve: Short fuss → cry → wail if needs stack up. Evening "witching hour" is classic
- Your baby's signature: Pitch, timing, what soothes. Treat it like a codebook you're learning

**Why it matters**
- **Communication:** You respond, baby learns "signals work." That's secure attachment 101
- **Brain regulation:** Repeated soothing wires the calming systems that later help with self-settling
- **Health signal:** Tracking typical vs. atypical crying helps you spot when something's off

---

#### Calms when spoken to or picked up

**About**

One of the most reassuring early milestones is your baby's response to your presence. When you speak softly or pick them up, they should show some sign of settling—the cry may quiet, the body may relax, or they may look toward you. This is early evidence that your baby recognizes you as a source of comfort and that their nervous system can down-regulate with your help.

**What to look for**
- Reduction in crying intensity or duration when picked up
- Pausing or quieting when hearing your voice
- Body relaxing or molding into your arms
- Shift from distressed crying to softer fussing
- Brief periods of calm alertness after being soothed
- Faster settling over time as baby learns your cues

**Why it matters**

This responsiveness is the heart of secure attachment. When babies learn that their caregivers reliably help them feel better, they develop trust and the capacity to regulate their own emotions later. It also helps you build confidence as a parent—you're learning what works, and your baby is learning that they're safe with you.

---

#### Looks at your face

**About**

From birth, babies are drawn to faces—especially yours. High-contrast features (eyes, hairline, mouth) and face-like patterns grab their attention more than random objects. Over the first 8–12 weeks, this preference strengthens: they linger on faces, track you more smoothly, and start pairing faces with warm social cues (the first real smiles). Typical range: interest in faces from birth; clear preference and longer looks by 1–3 months. Preterm babies usually follow their corrected age.

**What to look for**
- Longer gaze on faces: Baby stares at your face longer than at a toy with similar brightness or movement
- "Face distance" sweet spot: Best engagement at 20–30 cm (about the distance from your chest to your face when held)
- Eyes > everything: Frequent fixation on your eyes, hairline, or mouth; brief glances back if they look away
- Early tracking: By ~2 months, smoother side-to-side tracking of your face at close range
- State-dependent: Most interest during calm-alert periods; gaze drops when hungry, gassy, or tired
- Emerging social cues: By 6–8 weeks, brighter expression and early smiles while looking at faces

**Why it matters**
- **Bonding + safety:** Recognizing and preferring caregiver faces anchors trust and regulation
- **Social brain wiring:** Faces carry emotion and intent; paying attention to them lays the groundwork for joint attention and, later, language
- **Vision practice:** Fixating and tracking faces strengthens visual acuity and eye-movement control

---

### COGNITIVE

#### Fixes on bright objects and follows with eyes

**About**

Newborns can see from birth, but their vision is blurry—best at 8–12 inches away. They're drawn to high-contrast patterns and bright objects. In the first weeks, your baby will fix (stare) at objects briefly and may follow them a short distance with their eyes. By 2–3 months, tracking becomes smoother and covers a wider range. This is the beginning of visual attention and hand-eye coordination.

**What to look for**
- Brief fixation on high-contrast or brightly colored objects
- Following an object for a few inches before losing track
- Preference for faces over objects
- Increasing smoothness of eye movements over the first month
- Best tracking at 8–12 inches distance
- Following objects side to side, then eventually up and down

**Why it matters**

Visual tracking is essential for learning about the world. It strengthens eye muscles, builds attention, and sets up hand-eye coordination for reaching and grasping. Difficulties with tracking can signal vision problems or developmental delays that benefit from early intervention.

---

#### Likes to look at faces more than objects

**About**

From birth, babies are drawn to faces—especially yours. High-contrast features (eyes, hairline, mouth) and face-like patterns grab their attention more than random objects. Over the first 8–12 weeks, this preference strengthens: they linger on faces, track you more smoothly, and start pairing faces with warm social cues (the first real smiles). Typical range: interest in faces from birth; clear preference and longer looks by 1–3 months. Preterm babies usually follow their corrected age.

**What to look for**
- Longer gaze on faces: Baby stares at your face longer than at a toy with similar brightness or movement
- "Face distance" sweet spot: Best engagement at 20–30 cm (about the distance from your chest to your face when held)
- Eyes > everything: Frequent fixation on your eyes, hairline, or mouth; brief glances back if they look away
- Early tracking: By ~2 months, smoother side-to-side tracking of your face at close range
- State-dependent: Most interest during calm-alert periods; gaze drops when hungry, gassy, or tired
- Emerging social cues: By 6–8 weeks, brighter expression and early smiles while looking at faces

**Why it matters**
- **Bonding + safety:** Recognizing and preferring caregiver faces anchors trust and regulation
- **Social brain wiring:** Faces carry emotion and intent; paying attention to them lays the groundwork for joint attention and, later, language
- **Vision practice:** Fixating and tracking faces strengthens visual acuity and eye-movement control

---

#### Can search for and suck from breast or bottle

**About**

Newborns arrive with powerful rooting and sucking reflexes. Put simply: if something touches their cheek or lips, they turn, open wide, and try to latch. Coordination of the suck–swallow–breathe rhythm starts from birth and gets smoother over the first weeks. Typical range: present from birth; coordination improves notably by 2–6 weeks. Preterm babies usually follow their corrected age.

**What to look for**
- Searching ("rooting"): Turns head toward touch, opens mouth, tongue drops forward like a little scoop
- Latching: Wide gape, lips flanged out, chin pressed into breast/bottle base; cheeks rounded (not dimpled)
- Rhythm: Bursts of sucks, brief pauses, then repeat. You'll hear or see regular swallows
- Relaxed body at the end: Hands unclench, milk-dribble or sleepy "milk drunk" face
- Efficiency trends: Feeds start long and messy, then shorten and smooth out over weeks
- Bottle specifics: Minimal leaking, steady pace, no frantic gulping or coughing with an appropriate flow nipple

**Why it matters**
- **Nutrition + growth:** This is how your baby fuels brain and body
- **Airway protection:** Coordinated sucking and swallowing keeps milk out of the lungs
- **Oral-motor foundation:** The same muscles support later chewing and speech
- **Bonding + regulation:** Suckling, skin contact, and your smell calm the nervous system

---

### GROWTH

#### Birth weight and length

**About**

At birth, healthy full-term babies show a wide range of normal weights and lengths. Average birth weight is around 7–7.5 pounds (3.2–3.4 kg) for boys and slightly less for girls, though the normal range extends from about 5.5 to 10 pounds. Birth length averages around 19–20 inches (49–50 cm). In the first week, babies typically lose 5–10% of birth weight (mostly water weight) before beginning to gain steadily. Weight gain in the first month is rapid—typically 5–7 ounces per week.

**What to look for**
- Birth weight: Boys average 7 lb 6 oz (3.3 kg); Girls average 7 lb 2 oz (3.2 kg)
- Birth length: Boys average 19.7 inches (50 cm); Girls average 19.3 inches (49 cm)
- Initial weight loss of 5–10% in first week is normal
- Weight regained by 2 weeks of age
- Steady weight gain of 5–7 oz per week after initial period
- Regular monitoring at well-baby visits

**Why it matters**

Growth in the first month is a key indicator of health and adequate nutrition. Consistent weight gain shows that feeding (breast or bottle) is effective and that the baby is thriving. Healthcare providers track growth carefully during this period to ensure babies are getting enough nutrition and to identify any issues early. Growth patterns establish the foundation for healthy development throughout infancy.

### TEETH

#### Primary teeth developing beneath gums

**About**

Although you can't see them yet, all 20 primary teeth are developing beneath your newborn's gums. Tooth buds began forming during pregnancy, and the mineralization process continues after birth. Most babies won't show visible teeth until around 4–7 months, but the development happening beneath the surface is crucial. Some babies are born with teeth (natal teeth) or develop them in the first month (neonatal teeth), though this is rare.

**What to look for**
- No visible teeth (normal for this age)
- Gums are smooth and pink
- Baby may bring hands to mouth (normal reflex, not teething)
- Drooling is minimal at this age
- No signs of teething discomfort yet
- Rare cases: natal or neonatal teeth (consult pediatrician)

**Why it matters**

Understanding that teeth are developing even when invisible helps parents prepare for teething ahead. The foundation of dental health starts now—even before teeth emerge. Good oral hygiene habits (wiping gums gently after feeding) can begin in this first month. Rarely, natal or neonatal teeth may need evaluation to ensure they're securely attached and not causing feeding difficulties.

---

### VISION

#### Blurry vision with close-range focus

**About**

Newborns can see from birth, but their vision is blurry—estimated at about 20/400 (compared to adult 20/20 vision). They see best at 8–12 inches away—the perfect distance from breast or bottle to your face during feeding. At birth, babies perceive light and dark and are drawn to high-contrast patterns (black and white, bold stripes). Their eyes may appear uncoordinated or crossed at times, which is normal as the eye muscles are still developing. Color perception is limited—they primarily see in shades of gray with some sensitivity to bright colors.

**What to look for**
- Focuses on objects 8–12 inches away (feeding distance)
- Prefers high-contrast patterns over solid colors
- Looks at faces more than other objects
- Eyes may appear uncoordinated or drift (normal if occasional)
- Perceives light and dark
- Blinks at bright lights
- Limited color vision at this age

**Why it matters**

Vision development in the first month sets up the visual pathways in the brain. Even though vision is blurry, babies are taking in critical visual information—especially about faces and patterns. The preference for faces is hardwired and essential for bonding and social development. Eye coordination develops over the first months, and occasional crossing or drifting is normal. Persistent eye issues (constant crossing, one eye turning) warrant pediatric evaluation.

---

### HEARING

#### Hearing fully functioning at birth

**About**

Unlike vision, which develops gradually, hearing is fully functional at birth. Babies have been hearing sounds in the womb since around 18 weeks of pregnancy—especially mother's voice, heartbeat, and rhythmic sounds. At birth, they recognize familiar voices and show clear responses to sounds. The startle (Moro) reflex to sudden loud noises is strong in the first weeks. Newborns can distinguish their mother's voice from strangers' voices and show preference for familiar sounds.

**What to look for**
- Startle reflex (Moro) to sudden loud sounds
- Calming to familiar voices, especially mother's
- Pausing or stilling when someone speaks
- Turning eyes or head slightly toward sounds
- Different responses to different sounds (voice vs. background noise)
- Reacts to loud sounds by blinking, changing breathing, or crying
- Quiets when hearing soothing voices or music

**Why it matters**

Functional hearing from birth is critical for language development, bonding, and safety. Babies learn language by hearing it long before they can speak. Early hearing problems can significantly impact speech and language development, which is why newborn hearing screens are standard. Responding to sounds shows that auditory pathways are working, which is foundational for all future communication and learning.

## 1-3 MONTHS

### GROSS MOTOR SKILLS

#### Lifts chest on tummy (2 months)

**About**

This is early prone extension—baby starts to push up on their forearms and lift the head and upper chest off the surface. At first it's a quick bob; over the next few weeks it becomes a steadier prop. Typical range: first clear chest lift shows up 6–12 weeks, gets stronger by 3 months, and by 4 months most babies can prop on elbows with the head held high. Premature babies follow their corrected age.

**What to look for**
- Forearms under shoulders: Elbows come forward toward the chest; weight settles on the forearms, not clenched fists tucked under
- Head and chest lift: From a face-down start, baby lifts the chin, then the upper chest for a few seconds
- Smoother breathing/less face-planting: Early lifts are wobbly; by the end of month 2 they can pause and look around briefly
- Open hands: Fingers loosen and press into the surface for stability
- Short "sets": Several 20–60 second efforts rather than one long session
- Symmetry: Both shoulders work; head can turn to both sides

**Why it matters**
- Neck and back strength for head control, rolling, and, later, sitting
- Shoulder and hand readiness for reaching, grasping, and protective reactions
- Sensory input to the chest, arms, and palms—big for body awareness
- Head-shape protection: Time off the back helps prevent flat spots

---

#### Keeps head upright when held (2 months)

**About**

This is early head control—your baby starts using neck and upper-back muscles to hold the head up against gravity when you hold them upright on your shoulder or in supported sitting. At first you'll see quick bobbing and brief holds; over the next weeks the holds get steadier and longer. Typical range: first reliable short holds around 6–10 weeks, clearly steadier by 3–4 months, and solid head control (with turns) by 5–6 months. Premature babies follow their corrected age.

**What to look for**
- Upright on your shoulder: brief head lift to midline, a little bobbing, then a steady 3–10-second hold
- Supported sitting on your lap: less "flop forward," chin hovers off chest, head stays mostly centered
- Turns both ways: tracks a voice/toy right and left without collapsing
- Reduced head-lag on pull-to-sit: when you gently pull from lying to sitting, the head doesn't fully trail behind
- Works across positions: better head control on your chest/tummy time usually shows better control when held too
- Symmetry: no persistent tilt, turn, or preference to one side

**Why it matters**
- **Airway safety:** Keeping the chin off the chest protects breathing
- **Vision + exploration:** A steady head lets babies scan faces and the room
- **Motor foundation:** Sets up rolling, propping on forearms, and later sitting
- **Head-shape protection:** More upright time means less constant pressure on the back of the skull

---

#### Opens hands briefly (2 months)

**About**

By 2 months, the tight fisting of the newborn period begins to release more consistently. Babies start opening their hands for longer periods—maybe 30–60% of awake time—and the thumb separates from the palm more often. This is setting the stage for voluntary grasping, which typically emerges around 3–4 months.

**What to look for**
- Hands open during calm, alert states
- Fingers splayed or loosely curled rather than tightly fisted
- Thumb visible outside the palm
- Brief "holds" if you place a rattle in the palm
- Bringing hands to midline or mouth
- Symmetrical opening on both sides

**Why it matters**

Open hands allow babies to explore through touch—critical for sensory and cognitive development. It's also the prerequisite for reaching, grasping, and eventually self-feeding. Persistent fisting beyond this age can indicate high muscle tone or other issues worth evaluating.

---

#### Good head control when seated (3 months)

**About**

By 3 months, most babies can hold their head steady and upright when sitting with support on your lap or in a baby seat. The bobbing decreases significantly, and they can maintain midline position while looking around. This doesn't mean independent sitting—just that the neck and upper back are strong enough to support the head against gravity.

**What to look for**
- Head stays upright for 10+ seconds without dropping
- Can turn head side to side to track objects or voices
- Minimal wobbling or head lag
- Maintains head position even when slightly jostled
- Looks around purposefully while seated
- Symmetrical control—no persistent tilting

**Why it matters**

Strong head control in supported sitting is a gateway to independent sitting (usually 6–9 months) and indicates healthy development of the vestibular system (balance) and core muscles. It also allows babies to engage more actively with their environment and caregivers.

---

#### Rests on forearms on tummy (3 months)

**About**

This is the classic "tummy time pose"—elbows forward under or slightly in front of the shoulders, forearms bearing weight, chest and head lifted. By 3 months, many babies can sustain this position for a minute or more, looking around with interest. It's a huge leap from the face-planting of earlier weeks.

**What to look for**
- Elbows positioned under shoulders
- Weight distributed through forearms and hands
- Chest clearly off the surface
- Head held at 45–90 degrees
- Can hold position for 30–60+ seconds
- Active looking around while propped
- Open hands pressing into surface

**Why it matters**

Forearm propping builds the shoulder, back, and neck strength needed for rolling, sitting, and crawling. It also gives babies a new perspective on the world, encouraging visual and cognitive development. Strong tummy time skills predict better motor milestones ahead.

---

#### Hands loose most of the time (3 months)

**About**

By 3 months, the newborn reflex to keep fists clenched has largely faded. Babies now keep their hands open and relaxed 50–80% of the time. They actively bring hands together at midline, reach toward objects (even if they don't always connect), and explore their own hands visually and tactilely.

**What to look for**
- Hands predominantly open during alert states
- Active finger movements and stretches
- Bringing hands together at chest or midline
- Watching their own hands move
- Reaching toward objects, faces, or toys
- Mouthing hands frequently
- Symmetrical hand use

**Why it matters**

Loose, active hands are essential for exploration and learning. Babies use their hands to learn about textures, weight, temperature, and spatial relationships. This stage directly precedes voluntary grasping and reaching, which typically solidify by 4–5 months.

---

#### Uses eyes to follow objects in circular pattern (3 months)

**About**

By 3 months, visual tracking matures significantly. Babies can now follow an object smoothly through a full 180-degree arc (side to side) and even in circular patterns. The eyes work together more consistently, and tracking is smoother and more sustained than in earlier months.

**What to look for**
- Smooth tracking of moving objects side to side
- Follows objects in circular or curved paths
- Tracks across midline without losing focus
- Both eyes move together (no drifting or turning)
- Sustained attention for 30+ seconds
- Can follow objects at varying distances

**Why it matters**

Mature visual tracking supports hand-eye coordination, spatial awareness, and attention. It's essential for later skills like catching, reading, and detailed visual tasks. Difficulties with tracking can indicate vision problems that benefit from early intervention.

---

#### Bats at objects (3 months)

**About**

Around 3 months, babies start swinging their arms toward objects dangling in front of them—this is "batting." It's not precise reaching yet; it's more like enthusiastic swipes that sometimes connect. This is the bridge between random arm movements and intentional reaching, which typically emerges by 4–5 months.

**What to look for**
- Arm movements directed toward objects
- Multiple attempts to contact toys or mobiles
- Excitement and engagement during batting
- Both arms participating (not necessarily equally)
- Sometimes successful contact
- Increasing accuracy over time

**Why it matters**

Batting is the first step toward hand-eye coordination. It shows that your baby sees an object, wants to interact with it, and is learning to use their body to make that happen. This exploration builds the neural pathways for reaching, grasping, and eventually manipulating objects.

### COMMUNICATION

#### Looks at people talking (2 months)

**About**

By 2 months, babies don't just hear voices—they actively look for them. When someone speaks, your baby will turn their head and eyes toward the speaker, studying their face with increasing focus. This is the beginning of "joint attention"—paying attention to what others are focused on—which is critical for language and social development.

**What to look for**
- Turning head toward the sound of voices
- Gazing at the speaker's face
- Following the speaker's face as they move
- Brightening or showing interest when someone talks
- Preferring human voices over other sounds
- Quieting or pausing activity to listen

**Why it matters**

Looking at faces while listening connects sound with social meaning. Babies learn that communication involves both seeing and hearing, and they begin to map facial expressions to vocal tones. This integration is foundational for language development and social understanding.

---

#### Responds to voice (2 months)

**About**

By 2 months, babies show clear responses when you speak to them—they may smile, wiggle, coo back, or quiet down to listen. This is early conversational turn-taking and shows that your baby understands that voices are for interaction, not just background noise.

**What to look for**
- Smiling or brightening when spoken to
- Cooing or making sounds in response
- Quieting to listen when you speak
- Excited body movements (kicking, arm waving)
- Different responses to different tones (calm vs. excited)
- Eye contact while you're talking

**Why it matters**

Responding to voices is the foundation of all conversation. When babies learn that their sounds get responses, they're motivated to "talk" more. This back-and-forth is how language develops—through thousands of small exchanges that wire the brain for communication.

---

#### Makes cooing noises (2 months)

**About**

Around 6–8 weeks, babies begin producing soft vowel-like sounds—coos. These are different from the reflexive gurgles of earlier weeks; coos are more intentional, produced when the baby is content, and often directed at faces. Common sounds include "ooh," "aah," and "eh." This is your baby's first real "talking."

**What to look for**
- Soft, musical vowel sounds
- Produced during happy, alert states
- Directed at faces or interesting objects
- Back-and-forth "conversations" where baby coos, pauses, then coos again
- Increasing variety of sounds
- Pleasure in making sounds (smiling, repeating)

**Why it matters**

Cooing is the first stage of vocal development that leads to babbling and eventually speech. Each coo strengthens the muscles used for talking and teaches babies about sound production. When you coo back, you're showing them the rhythm of conversation and encouraging more vocal practice.

---

#### Chuckles (3 months)

**About**

Around 3 months, many babies produce their first laughs—breathy chuckles that emerge during play or in response to funny faces, sounds, or tickles. These early laughs are often surprises to the babies themselves! Over the next months, laughter becomes louder, more frequent, and more social.

**What to look for**
- Short, breathy laugh sounds (not yet full belly laughs)
- Triggered by social interaction, tickles, or silly sounds
- Accompanied by big smiles
- Repeating actions that made them laugh
- Anticipating funny moments (smiling before the tickle)
- Increasing frequency over the next months

**Why it matters**

Laughter is a powerful social bonding tool. It shows that your baby finds interactions pleasurable and is developing a sense of humor. Laughter also reinforces connections—when you make your baby laugh, you're both motivated to keep the interaction going. This mutual joy strengthens attachment and teaches social reciprocity.

---

#### Echoes sounds (3 months)

**About**

By 3 months, babies begin to imitate sounds they hear—especially vowel sounds. If you say "ooh," your baby might say "ooh" back. This vocal imitation is a huge cognitive leap: your baby is listening, processing, and trying to reproduce what they hear. It's the foundation of language learning.

**What to look for**
- Attempting to copy vowel sounds you make
- Turn-taking "conversations" where you vocalize, baby responds, you respond back
- Matching pitch or tone (even if not exact)
- Increasing accuracy over time
- Pleasure and engagement during sound play
- Persistence in trying to reproduce sounds

**Why it matters**

Imitation is how babies learn language. Every time your baby tries to copy your sounds, they're practicing motor control, listening skills, and the social rules of conversation. Responding enthusiastically to these attempts encourages more practice and accelerates language development.

---

#### Copies sounds like 'ooh' and 'aah' (3 months)

**About**

This is the same skill as echoing sounds—by 3 months, babies actively try to reproduce vowel sounds they hear. This shows sophisticated integration of hearing, vocal cord control, and social motivation. It's the beginning of true language learning.

**What to look for**
- Producing "ooh," "aah," "eh" sounds after hearing them
- Engaged in vocal play with caregivers
- Watching mouths closely while sounds are made
- Attempting different sounds (even if approximate)
- Turn-taking in vocal exchanges
- Increasing variety and accuracy

**Why it matters**

Copying sounds is the mechanism through which all language is learned. By imitating, babies build the motor programs for speech and learn which sounds are important in their language. Encouraging this through responsive vocal play accelerates language development significantly.

---

### SOCIAL & EMOTIONAL

#### Smiles back at you (2 months)

**About**

Around 6–8 weeks, the first real "social smiles" emerge—smiles directed at faces in response to interaction, not just gas or random reflexes. Your baby sees your face, recognizes you, and smiles deliberately. This is one of the most magical parenting moments and a huge milestone in social development.

**What to look for**
- Smiles triggered by seeing faces, especially familiar ones
- Eye contact while smiling
- Smiles in response to talking, singing, or smiling at baby
- Repeat smiling in back-and-forth exchanges
- Bigger smiles for familiar people
- Smiles accompanied by cooing or body movements

**Why it matters**

Social smiling is the first clear signal that your baby recognizes you and enjoys your presence. It's the foundation of attachment and mutual joy. Smiling together releases oxytocin in both of you, strengthening your bond and motivating continued interaction. It's also a powerful reward for caregivers—proof that your efforts are working.

---

#### Calms when spoken to (2 months)

**About**

By 2 months, babies can often be soothed by voice alone—especially familiar voices. When fussy or mildly upset, hearing you talk or sing may calm them without needing to be picked up. This shows that your baby associates your voice with safety and comfort.

**What to look for**
- Reduction in crying intensity when you speak
- Pausing or quieting to listen
- Calming more quickly with familiar voices
- Responding to tone (calm, soothing voice works better than sharp or loud)
- Sometimes can be soothed by voice before needing physical comfort
- Looking toward the voice while calming

**Why it matters**

This demonstrates secure attachment—your baby has learned that you are a source of comfort. It also shows developing emotional regulation: your baby can use external cues (your voice) to help manage their internal state. This is the beginning of self-soothing skills that develop over the first years.

---

#### Seems happy to see you (2 months)

**About**

By 2 months, babies show clear joy when they see familiar faces—brightening, smiling, kicking excitedly, or cooing. This is different from the passive gazing of earlier weeks; now there's unmistakable enthusiasm. Your baby is forming attachments and showing preference for the people who care for them.

**What to look for**
- Big smiles when you come into view
- Excited body movements (kicking, arm waving)
- Cooing or vocalizing at you
- Tracking your movement around the room
- Calming or brightening when you approach
- Different reactions to familiar vs. unfamiliar people

**Why it matters**

This joy in seeing you is the heart of attachment. It shows that your baby recognizes you, remembers you, and associates you with positive experiences. This secure base allows your baby to explore the world confidently, knowing they can return to you for safety and comfort.

---

#### More alert and interested (2 months)

**About**

By 2 months, babies have longer periods of quiet alertness—awake, content, and actively looking around. They're more engaged with faces, objects, and sounds. This increased alertness is driven by brain maturation and sets the stage for rapid learning in the months ahead.

**What to look for**
- Longer wake windows (60–90 minutes) without fussing
- Active looking around during alert periods
- Sustained attention to faces and objects
- Less time spent in drowsy or fussy states
- More interaction during wake time
- Clear "social" periods where baby seeks engagement

**Why it matters**

Alert, engaged time is when learning happens. The more time your baby spends calmly alert, the more opportunities for visual, auditory, and social learning. This alertness is also a sign of a healthy, maturing nervous system.

---

#### Cries vary by need (3 months)

**About**

By 3 months, most parents can distinguish different types of cries—hunger, tiredness, discomfort, overstimulation. Babies also develop more nuanced signals before crying, like fussing, whining, or specific body language. This makes communication clearer and caregiving more effective.

**What to look for**
- Distinct cry patterns for different needs
- Pre-cry signals (fussing, whining, rooting)
- You can predict needs based on cry type
- Faster responses to appropriate interventions
- Less crying overall as communication improves
- Body language that accompanies specific cries

**Why it matters**

Differentiated crying shows sophisticated communication. When you can read your baby's signals, you respond more effectively, which reduces frustration for both of you. It also strengthens attachment—your baby learns that their specific needs are met, building trust.

---

#### Gives warm smiles/laughs (3 months)

**About**

By 3 months, smiles and laughs are frequent, enthusiastic, and clearly social. Your baby lights up with joy during interactions, and their pleasure is contagious. This mutual delight is one of parenting's greatest rewards and a sign of healthy emotional development.

**What to look for**
- Frequent, genuine smiles during interaction
- Early laughs (breathy chuckles)
- Smiling in anticipation of fun moments
- Smiling at familiar faces and voices
- Longer, sustained smiling during play
- Smiling accompanied by vocalizations and body movements

**Why it matters**

Warm, frequent smiling indicates secure attachment and positive emotional development. It motivates continued interaction and strengthens bonds. Babies who smile and laugh frequently are building the neural pathways for joy, social connection, and resilience.

---

#### Cries when upset (3 months)

**About**

By 3 months, crying becomes more purposeful and communicative. Babies cry when genuinely upset—hungry, tired, uncomfortable, or separated from caregivers—and calm when needs are met. Crying is less reflexive and more about signaling specific problems.

**What to look for**
- Crying linked to specific triggers
- Consolability when needs are addressed
- Different cry patterns for different problems
- Escalation if needs aren't met
- Quick calming with appropriate response
- Use of other signals (reaching, fussing) before full crying

**Why it matters**

Purposeful crying shows cognitive development—your baby understands cause and effect ("I cry, someone helps"). It also allows for more effective caregiving. When crying is clearly linked to needs, you can respond specifically, which builds trust and emotional security.

---

#### Shows excitement with arms/legs (3 months)

**About**

By 3 months, babies express emotion through their whole body. When excited—seeing a favorite person, anticipating food, or during fun play—they kick their legs, wave their arms, wiggle, and vocalize enthusiastically. This full-body joy is developmentally appropriate and adorable.

**What to look for**
- Vigorous kicking when happy or excited
- Arm waving and reaching toward interesting things
- Whole-body wiggling during pleasurable moments
- Synchronization of movements with vocalizations
- Increased movement intensity with excitement
- Calmer body when content but not excited

**Why it matters**

Using the whole body to express emotion shows integration of motor and emotional systems. It's also social communication—your baby is telling you "I'm happy!" This expressiveness helps caregivers read emotional states and respond appropriately, strengthening attachment.

---

### COGNITIVE

#### Watches you move (2 months)

**About**

By 2 months, babies actively track caregivers as they move around. If you walk across the room, your baby's eyes (and later, head) will follow. This is early visual attention and shows that your baby finds you interesting and important.

**What to look for**
- Eyes following your movement across the room
- Head turning to follow when you move out of central vision
- Sustained tracking for several seconds
- Searching for you if you move out of sight
- Preference for tracking familiar people
- Smooth eye movements (not jumpy)

**Why it matters**

Tracking moving people builds visual motor skills and attention. It's also an early sign of attachment—your baby wants to keep you in sight. This skill supports later milestones like joint attention (looking where someone else is looking) and understanding social cues.

---

#### Looks at toys (2 months)

**About**

By 2 months, babies begin showing interest in objects, not just faces. They'll look at toys, mobiles, or colorful objects held in their view, especially high-contrast or moving items. Visual attention to objects is the first step toward reaching for and manipulating them.

**What to look for**
- Gazing at toys or mobiles
- Longer looks at high-contrast or bright objects
- Following dangling toys with eyes
- Shifting gaze between objects
- Still preferring faces over objects
- Increasing attention span for objects

**Why it matters**

Interest in objects drives cognitive development. Babies learn about color, shape, movement, and spatial relationships by looking. This visual exploration is the foundation for reaching, grasping, and eventually complex play and problem-solving.

---

#### Follows objects up/down (2 months)

**About**

By 2 months, visual tracking expands from horizontal to vertical. Babies can now follow objects moving up and down in addition to side to side. This shows maturation of eye muscle control and visual attention.

**What to look for**
- Following a toy moved slowly up and down
- Smooth eye movements vertically
- Tracking through the full range of motion
- Both eyes moving together
- Sustained attention during tracking
- Ability to track in multiple directions

**Why it matters**

Multi-directional tracking supports spatial awareness and hand-eye coordination. It's essential for later skills like catching, reaching, and navigating the environment. Strong visual tracking also supports reading and other detailed visual tasks later in childhood.

---

#### Holds rattle briefly (2 months)

**About**

By 2 months, if you place a rattle in your baby's hand, they can hold onto it briefly—maybe 5–30 seconds—before dropping it. This is still partly reflexive (palmar grasp), but it's becoming more voluntary. By 3–4 months, grasping becomes fully intentional.

**What to look for**
- Closing fingers around an object placed in hand
- Holding for several seconds before releasing
- Sometimes bringing the held object toward body or face
- May shake or move the object accidentally
- Both hands can do this (not always equally)
- Increasing duration over weeks

**Why it matters**

Holding objects is the bridge between reflexive grasping and voluntary manipulation. It allows babies to start learning about weight, texture, and how objects behave. This exploration is critical for cognitive and motor development.

---

#### Can look at 1-inch object held in front (3 months)

**About**

By 3 months, visual acuity improves significantly. Babies can now focus on smaller objects—down to about 1 inch—held at the optimal distance (8–12 inches). This shows that the visual system is maturing and that babies can attend to increasingly detailed stimuli.

**What to look for**
- Focusing on small objects or details
- Sustained gaze on small toys or patterns
- Tracking small objects as they move
- Interest in detailed pictures or patterns
- Clear focus (not just vague looking)
- Binocular vision (both eyes working together)

**Why it matters**

Improving visual acuity allows babies to learn more from their environment. They can see facial expressions more clearly, notice small objects worth reaching for, and begin to discriminate fine details. This supports cognitive, social, and motor development.

---

### GROWTH

#### Rapid weight and length gain

**About**

Growth during months 1–3 is remarkably rapid. Babies typically gain 5–7 ounces per week and add about 1 inch in length per month. By 1 month, boys average around 9 lb 15 oz and girls around 9 lb 4 oz. By 2 months, boys average 12 lb 6 oz and girls 11 lb 5 oz. By 3 months, boys typically weigh around 14 lb 2 oz and girls 12 lb 14 oz. This period represents some of the fastest growth in a child's entire life. Head circumference also increases steadily as the brain grows rapidly.

**What to look for**
- Steady weight gain of 5–7 oz per week
- Length gain of approximately 1 inch per month
- By 1 month: Boys ~10 lbs, Girls ~9 lbs
- By 2 months: Boys ~12.5 lbs, Girls ~11.5 lbs
- By 3 months: Boys ~14 lbs, Girls ~13 lbs
- Outgrowing newborn clothes and moving to larger sizes
- Regular monitoring at well-baby checkups

**Why it matters**

Rapid growth during this period reflects healthy nutrition and development. Consistent weight and length gain indicate that feeding is adequate and that the baby is thriving. Healthcare providers track growth curves carefully to ensure babies are following expected patterns. Deviations from expected growth patterns may indicate feeding issues, illness, or other concerns that need attention. This growth fuels the enormous brain development happening during these months.

---

### TEETH

#### Teeth developing beneath gums; teething may begin

**About**

During months 1–3, primary teeth continue developing beneath the gums. Most babies won't show visible teeth yet, but some early teethers may begin showing signs toward the end of this period or into month 4. Increased drooling often starts around 2–3 months as salivary glands mature—this is normal development, not necessarily teething. True teething symptoms (fussiness, gum sensitivity, chewing on hands/objects) typically appear closer to 4–7 months when the first teeth (lower central incisors) begin to emerge.

**What to look for**
- No visible teeth yet (normal)
- Increased drooling starting around 2–3 months
- Hands to mouth frequently (normal exploration, not necessarily teething)
- Gums remain smooth and pink
- Some babies may show early teething signs toward end of period
- Chewing on fingers or objects as hand-mouth coordination develops

**Why it matters**

Understanding the timeline of tooth development helps parents distinguish normal developmental drooling and hand-mouthing from actual teething. While teeth are forming, the foundation for oral health is being established. Parents can begin gentle gum care by wiping gums with a soft, damp cloth after feedings. This establishes good oral hygiene habits even before teeth emerge.

---

### VISION

#### Improving focus and color vision

**About**

Visual development advances significantly during months 1–3. By 2 months, babies can track moving objects more smoothly and focus on parents' faces with increasing clarity. By 3 months, the eyes work together much better, reducing the crossing or drifting seen in newborns. Color vision begins developing—babies start distinguishing colors, especially bright ones. Eye-hand coordination emerges as babies begin connecting what they see with hand movements (batting at objects). Visual range extends beyond the 8–12 inch newborn range.

**What to look for**
- By 2 months: Tracking moving objects smoothly, focusing on parent's face clearly
- By 3 months: Eyes working together consistently, less crossing or drifting
- Color vision developing—response to bright colors
- Eye-hand coordination beginning (batting at toys)
- Following objects in circular patterns
- Increased visual attention and engagement
- Preference for faces remains strong

**Why it matters**

Vision improvements during this period support all areas of development. Better visual tracking allows babies to learn from their environment. Coordinated eye movements (binocular vision) are essential for depth perception, which develops over the coming months. Emerging color vision enriches babies' visual world. Eye-hand coordination—connecting vision with movement—is foundational for reaching, grasping, and all future motor skills. If eyes continue to cross constantly or turn after 3 months, evaluation is recommended.

---

### HEARING

#### Vocal and auditory development

**About**

Hearing continues to mature during months 1–3. Babies become increasingly responsive to voices, turning toward familiar speakers and showing clear preferences for certain sounds. By 2–3 months, babies begin their own vocalizations—cooing and making vowel sounds—in response to voices they hear. They start to distinguish different tones (happy vs. stern) and react accordingly. The ability to localize sound sources improves—babies turn more purposefully toward voices and noises.

**What to look for**
- Vocalizing pleasure and displeasure (laughs, giggles, coos, cries)
- Making noise when talked to
- Changing pitch in cooing
- Turning toward sounds more consistently
- Different responses to different voice tones
- Quieting to listen to voices
- Beginning sound imitation (early vocal play)

**Why it matters**

Auditory development during this period is crucial for language learning. Babies are mapping the sounds of their native language, learning intonation patterns, and beginning to vocalize in response. The feedback loop—hearing sounds, making sounds, hearing responses—is how language develops. Responsiveness to different voice tones shows emotional and social learning. If babies don't respond to voices or sounds consistently by 3 months, hearing evaluation is recommended.

---

## 3-6 MONTHS

### GROSS MOTOR SKILLS

#### Holds head steady (4 months)

**About**

By 4 months, most babies have solid head control in all positions—upright, sitting with support, and during tummy time. The head stays steady without wobbling, and babies can turn it purposefully in all directions. This is a major motor milestone that opens the door to sitting and more complex movements.

**What to look for**
- Head stays upright and centered without support
- No wobbling or bobbing
- Turns head smoothly in all directions
- Maintains head position even when body is moved
- Lifts and holds head at 90 degrees during tummy time
- No head lag when pulled to sitting

**Why it matters**

Steady head control is essential for vision (stable visual field), feeding (safe swallowing), and all future motor skills. It indicates healthy development of the vestibular system, neck and back muscles, and motor control. It's also a prerequisite for independent sitting.

---

#### May roll front to back (4 months)

**About**

Around 4–5 months, many babies start rolling from their tummy to their back. This is usually the first direction of rolling because it's easier—gravity helps. Rolling is often accidental at first, then becomes more purposeful. Back-to-front rolling typically follows at 5–6 months.

**What to look for**
- Rolling from tummy to back during tummy time
- May happen accidentally when reaching for a toy
- More frequent over time
- Uses arm push or leg kick to initiate roll
- Sometimes surprised by the roll at first
- Beginning to roll both directions eventually

**Why it matters**

Rolling is the first form of independent mobility. It shows integration of muscle strength, balance, and coordination. It also indicates that your baby is learning to move purposefully toward goals (like a toy). Rolling sets up the motor patterns for sitting, crawling, and walking.

---

#### Sits with support (4 months)

**About**

By 4 months, babies can sit on your lap or in a supportive seat with minimal wobbling. They need external support (your hands, pillows, or a seat), but they're actively using their core and back muscles to stay upright. Independent sitting typically comes at 6–9 months.

**What to look for**
- Stays upright with hands-on support at hips or trunk
- Maintains position for several minutes
- Head steady while sitting
- Beginning to use arms for balance (propping forward)
- Interested in sitting position and looking around
- Minimal leaning or slumping

**Why it matters**

Supported sitting strengthens core muscles and builds the vestibular (balance) system. It also gives babies a new perspective—seated, they can see and interact with the world differently. This motivates reaching, playing with toys, and social engagement.

---

#### Clutches objects (4 months)

**About**

By 4 months, grasping becomes voluntary. Babies reach for objects and close their fingers around them deliberately (not just reflexively). This "palmar grasp" uses the whole hand, fingers curling toward the palm. The pincer grasp (thumb and finger) comes later, around 9 months.

**What to look for**
- Reaching for objects with open hands
- Closing fingers around objects when they make contact
- Holding objects for extended periods (minutes)
- Bringing objects to mouth to explore
- Shaking or manipulating grasped objects
- Both hands can grasp (not always equally)

**Why it matters**

Voluntary grasping is a huge cognitive and motor leap. It shows intentionality: "I see something, I want it, I make my body get it." Grasping allows babies to explore objects through touch and mouthing, which is how they learn about the physical world.

---

#### Reaches out (4 months)

**About**

Around 4 months, babies begin purposeful reaching—extending arms toward objects they want to touch or grasp. Early reaches are often imprecise and may involve both arms reaching together. Over the next months, reaching becomes more accurate and one-handed.

**What to look for**
- Arms extending toward toys, faces, or interesting objects
- Often both arms reach together at first
- Hands may open in anticipation
- Increasing accuracy over time
- Persistence if first attempt misses
- Preference for certain toys or objects

**Why it matters**

Reaching is goal-directed behavior—it shows planning, motivation, and hand-eye coordination. It's the foundation for all manipulative skills: grasping, transferring, feeding, writing. Reaching also drives cognitive development: babies learn that they can cause things to happen.

---

#### Lifts head when sitting (5 months)

**About**

By 5 months, when sitting with support, babies can lift and hold their head in a fully upright position, even when you lean them slightly forward or to the side. This is more advanced than the basic head control of earlier months and shows strong neck and upper back strength.

**What to look for**
- Head remains upright even when trunk is tilted
- Can look up, down, side to side while sitting
- No forward flopping when leaning forward
- Active head control during play
- Smooth, controlled head movements
- Symmetrical control in all directions

**Why it matters**

Advanced head control in sitting is a sign that independent sitting is approaching. It also indicates a well-developed vestibular system, which supports balance and spatial orientation. Strong head control in sitting allows babies to engage in more complex play and social interaction.

---

#### Sits with support (6 months)

**About**

By 6 months, most babies sit with minimal support—perhaps just a hand lightly on the back or sitting in a corner of pillows. They're actively using core muscles and may start "tripod sitting" (leaning forward on hands). Independent sitting usually emerges over the next 1–3 months.

**What to look for**
- Sitting with light support for several minutes
- Using hands to prop forward (tripod sitting)
- Core engaged, back relatively straight
- Can play with toys while sitting
- Beginning to balance without constant support
- Able to right themselves if tilted slightly

**Why it matters**

Supported sitting at 6 months shows that independent sitting is imminent. It strengthens core muscles, builds balance, and allows two-handed play. Sitting also changes how babies interact with caregivers and the environment—it's a more social, engaged position.

---

#### Rolls back to front (6 months)

**About**

Around 5–6 months, babies master rolling from back to tummy. This direction is harder than tummy-to-back (earlier) because it requires more strength and coordination. Once babies can roll both ways, they start using rolling to move around and reach toys.

**What to look for**
- Rolling from back to tummy purposefully
- May roll repeatedly (rolling across the room)
- Uses legs, arms, or twisting to initiate
- Can roll both directions (tummy-back and back-tummy)
- Increasing speed and smoothness
- Sometimes gets "stuck" on tummy and fusses

**Why it matters**

Rolling both ways is true mobility—babies can now move toward things they want. It builds spatial awareness, problem-solving, and motor planning. It's also a safety milestone: once babies can roll, they can roll off surfaces, so supervision increases.

---

#### Moves things hand to hand (6 months)

**About**

Around 6 months, babies start transferring objects from one hand to the other—a skill called "hand-to-hand transfer." This shows bilateral coordination (using both sides of the body together) and is a precursor to more complex two-handed activities like clapping and holding a bottle.

**What to look for**
- Picking up an object with one hand
- Reaching across with the other hand
- Releasing from first hand and grasping with second
- May do this multiple times in a row
- Can transfer objects of various sizes
- Both directions of transfer (left to right, right to left)

**Why it matters**

Hand-to-hand transfer shows brain integration—the two sides of the body working together. It's essential for future skills like self-feeding, dressing, and playing with complex toys. It also indicates healthy development of the corpus callosum, which connects the brain's two hemispheres.

---

### COMMUNICATION

#### Laughs out loud (4 months)

**About**

By 4 months, those early breathy chuckles become full, joyful laughs—clear "ha ha ha" sounds that are unmistakable. Babies laugh at funny faces, sounds, physical play like tickling, and social games like peek-a-boo. Laughter is frequent and contagious.

**What to look for**
- Clear, audible laughing sounds
- Triggered by social interaction, physical play, or funny sounds
- Repeated attempts to recreate funny moments
- Laughing with whole body (kicking, wiggling)
- Anticipating funny moments and laughing before they happen
- Increasingly easy to make laugh

**Why it matters**

Laughter is social glue. It strengthens bonds, motivates interaction, and creates shared joy. Babies who laugh frequently are practicing emotional regulation (managing excitement), social reciprocity, and communication. Laughter also indicates cognitive development—understanding that something is surprising or incongruous.

---

#### Moves toward voice (4 months)

**About**

By 4 months, babies orient their whole body toward sounds, especially voices. They'll turn their head, shift their gaze, and even begin reaching or moving toward the source of a familiar voice. This shows integration of hearing, motor control, and social motivation.

**What to look for**
- Turning head and body toward voice
- Searching for the speaker if not visible
- Preference for familiar voices
- Reaching or leaning toward the voice
- Brightening or vocalizing in response
- Sustained attention to the speaker

**Why it matters**

Moving toward voices shows social motivation and auditory localization skills. It's an early form of "joint attention"—paying attention to what others are focused on—which is critical for language and social development. It also indicates healthy hearing and motor coordination.

---

#### Makes 'ah-goo' sounds (4 months)

**About**

Around 4–5 months, cooing expands into more complex vocalizations that include consonant-vowel combinations like "ah-goo," "ah-gah," or "oo-gah." These are precursors to true babbling and show increasing vocal control and experimentation.

**What to look for**
- Sounds that combine vowels and consonant-like sounds
- Back-of-throat sounds ("g," "k")
- Increasing variety and complexity
- Produced during social interaction and solo play
- Pleasure in making sounds
- Responsive "conversations" with caregivers

**Why it matters**

These early consonant-vowel combinations are the building blocks of babbling, which emerges around 6 months. Each new sound represents increased vocal motor control and cognitive development. Encouraging these sounds through imitation and response accelerates language development.

---

#### Smiles at self in mirror (5 months)

**About**

Around 5 months, babies delight in their own reflection. They smile, vocalize, and reach toward the "other baby" in the mirror. They don't yet understand it's themselves (that comes around 18–24 months), but they're fascinated by the social feedback.

**What to look for**
- Smiling at mirror reflection
- Reaching toward or touching the mirror
- Vocalizing at reflection
- Sustained interest in mirror play
- Different reactions to mirror vs. other objects
- Social behavior toward reflection (smiling, cooing)

**Why it matters**

Interest in mirrors shows visual processing and social motivation. Babies treat their reflection like a social partner, which practices all the social skills they're developing. Mirror play also builds self-awareness, which eventually leads to recognizing oneself.

---

#### Copies voice (5 months)

**About**

By 5 months, vocal imitation becomes more sophisticated. Babies can copy pitch, rhythm, and increasingly complex sounds. If you make a silly sound, your baby might try to reproduce it. This turn-taking vocal play is how language develops.

**What to look for**
- Attempting to match sounds you make
- Copying pitch (high vs. low)
- Matching rhythm patterns
- Engaging in extended vocal play
- Taking turns in "conversation"
- Pleasure and persistence in imitating

**Why it matters**

Vocal imitation is the engine of language learning. Babies are practicing the motor patterns of speech, learning which sounds are important, and discovering that communication is reciprocal. Responsive vocal play accelerates language development and strengthens bonds.

#### Makes raspberry sounds (5 months)

**About**

Around 4–6 months, babies discover how to blow air through closed lips—making "raspberries" or "Bronx cheers." This is oral motor exploration that strengthens lips and teaches breath control. It's also hilarious and often becomes a favorite game.

**What to look for**
- Blowing air through lips to make buzzing sounds
- Doing it repeatedly, often with delight
- Making raspberries at faces, during play, or solo
- Experimenting with volume and duration
- Sometimes accompanied by drool
- Turn-taking raspberry games with caregivers

**Why it matters**

Raspberries build oral motor skills used for feeding and speech. They teach breath control, lip strength, and coordination. They're also social—babies quickly learn that raspberries get big reactions, which teaches communication and humor.

#### Babbles 'baba' 'gagaga' (6 months)

**About**

Around 6 months, true babbling emerges: repeated consonant-vowel combinations like "bababa," "dadada," or "gagaga." This is called "canonical babbling" and is a major language milestone. Babies often babble in long strings, experimenting with sounds, pitch, and rhythm.

**What to look for**
- Clear, repeated syllables: "ba-ba-ba," "da-da-da," "ma-ma-ma"
- Long strings of babbling (several syllables)
- Variation in pitch and volume (sounds like "talking")
- Babbling during play and social interaction
- Practicing sounds alone (babbling to self)
- Using common consonants: b, d, m, g

**Why it matters**

Babbling is direct practice for real words. Babies are learning the motor patterns of speech, discovering which sounds exist in their language, and experimenting with communication. Languages with more babbling in infancy predict earlier first words and larger vocabularies.

---

#### Turns to sounds/noises (6 months)

**About**

By 6 months, babies consistently and quickly turn toward sounds. Drop a toy across the room, and your baby will pivot to look. Call their name, and they'll turn to you. This is mature auditory localization and shows integration of hearing, motor control, and attention.

**What to look for**
- Quick, accurate head turns toward sounds
- Localizing sounds from various directions
- Turning toward quiet sounds (not just loud)
- Searching if sound source is not visible
- Preference for interesting sounds (voices, music)
- Using vision to confirm sound source

**Why it matters**

Sound localization is essential for safety (hearing danger), communication (knowing who's talking), and learning (paying attention to important sounds). It indicates healthy hearing and motor coordination. Difficulties can signal hearing loss or developmental delays.

---

#### Enjoys back-and-forth talking (6 months)

**About**

By 6 months, babies are enthusiastic conversational partners. They babble, you respond, they babble back—clear turn-taking that resembles real conversation. Babies often watch faces closely, matching the rhythm and intonation of speech even before using real words.

**What to look for**
- Babbling, then pausing for your response
- Continuing "conversation" for multiple exchanges
- Matching your intonation and rhythm
- Eye contact during exchanges
- Pleasure and engagement in turn-taking
- Using gestures along with vocalizations

**Why it matters**

Turn-taking is the structure of all conversation. Babies who engage in these early "chats" are learning the social rules of communication: taking turns, listening, responding. This practice predicts language development and social skills.

---

### SOCIAL & EMOTIONAL

#### Recognizes mother (4 months)

**About**

By 4 months, babies clearly recognize primary caregivers and show distinct preferences. They smile bigger, calm faster, and engage more enthusiastically with familiar people. This recognition is based on sight, sound, smell, and touch—babies know you through all their senses.

**What to look for**
- Bigger smiles for familiar people
- Calming faster with primary caregivers
- Tracking caregivers around the room
- Showing excitement when familiar people appear
- Preference for familiar faces over strangers
- Different responses to different caregivers

**Why it matters**

Recognizing caregivers is the foundation of secure attachment. It shows memory, social bonding, and emotional differentiation. Babies who know and prefer their caregivers feel safe to explore, learn, and develop independence later.

---

#### Smiles spontaneously (5 months)

**About**

By 5 months, babies smile frequently and spontaneously—not just in response to interaction. They smile at objects, during solo play, while looking around, and when content. Smiling is a clear expression of pleasure and well-being.

**What to look for**
- Smiling without prompting
- Smiling at toys, the environment, or during play
- Frequent smiles throughout the day
- Smiling accompanied by vocalizations
- Happy, content demeanor
- Smiling at memories or anticipation

**Why it matters**

Spontaneous smiling indicates emotional well-being and cognitive development (smiling at thoughts or memories). It shows that your baby is happy, engaged, and experiencing positive emotions. Frequent smiling is associated with secure attachment and healthy social-emotional development.

---

#### Reacts to voice tones (5 months)

**About**

By 5 months, babies clearly distinguish between happy, calm, and upset voices. A sharp "no" may startle them; a soothing voice calms them; an excited voice makes them smile. They're reading emotional content from tone, not just words.

**What to look for**
- Different responses to happy vs. stern voices
- Calming with soothing tones
- Startling or stilling with sharp tones
- Matching emotional tone (smiling at happy voice, becoming serious with stern voice)
- Sensitivity to caregiver emotions
- Using tone cues to understand situations

**Why it matters**

Reading vocal tone is the beginning of emotional understanding and empathy. It teaches babies about emotions, social cues, and expectations. Sensitivity to tone also supports language development—babies learn that how you say something matters as much as what you say.

---

#### Shows preference for person (6 months)

**About**

By 6 months, babies have clear preferences. They may strongly prefer one caregiver over others, especially for comfort. They light up for favorite people and may be wary or fussy with less familiar people. This is healthy attachment, not rejection.

**What to look for**
- Seeking out preferred caregiver for comfort
- Bigger smiles and more engagement with favorites
- Wariness or fussiness with less familiar people
- Reaching for preferred caregiver
- Calming faster with favorite people
- Protesting when preferred caregiver leaves

**Why it matters**

Showing preference is a sign of secure attachment. It means your baby has formed strong bonds and feels safe with certain people. This is healthy and necessary for emotional development. Preferences may shift over time and vary by context (one parent for play, another for comfort).

---

#### Gets upset without caregiver (6 months)

**About**

Around 6 months, separation anxiety begins emerging. Babies may cry when caregivers leave the room, even briefly. They're developing object permanence (understanding that things exist even when not visible) and realizing that when you leave, they can't see you—which feels scary.

**What to look for**
- Crying or fussing when caregiver leaves
- Tracking caregiver movements anxiously
- Difficulty calming without preferred person
- Clinginess when stressed or tired
- Reaching or calling out when caregiver moves away
- Calming when caregiver returns

**Why it matters**

Separation anxiety, while challenging for caregivers, is a healthy developmental milestone. It shows secure attachment—your baby knows who matters and wants them close. It also indicates cognitive development (object permanence). Separation anxiety typically peaks around 10–18 months and then gradually resolves.

---

#### Recognizes faces (6 months)

**About**

By 6 months, babies recognize familiar faces quickly and accurately, even across distances. They can differentiate dozens of familiar faces from unfamiliar ones and respond accordingly. Facial recognition is sophisticated and supports all social interaction.

**What to look for**
- Recognizing familiar people across the room
- Smiling at recognized faces
- Wariness or neutral response to unfamiliar faces
- Scanning faces for familiar features
- Different reactions to different familiar people
- Memory of faces seen regularly

**Why it matters**

Facial recognition is fundamental to social connection. It allows babies to know who is safe, who is fun, who provides comfort. It's also a window into memory and perceptual development. Strong facial recognition supports attachment, social learning, and safety.

---

#### Tries to hold bottle (6 months)

**About**

Around 6 months, babies begin reaching for and trying to hold their own bottle during feeding. At first they just rest their hands on it; gradually they grip and may hold briefly without help. This is early self-feeding and shows motor coordination and independence motivation.

**What to look for**
- Hands reaching for bottle during feeding
- Grasping bottle with both hands
- Briefly holding bottle (even if you still support it)
- Bringing bottle toward mouth
- Persistence in trying to hold it
- Increasing independence over weeks

**Why it matters**

Trying to hold the bottle shows motor skills (bilateral coordination), cognitive development (understanding cause and effect), and emerging independence. It's a step toward self-feeding, which supports self-esteem and motor development. Encouraging this helps babies develop autonomy.

---

### COGNITIVE

#### Reaches for and looks at objects held (4 months)

**About**

By 4 months, babies integrate looking and reaching—they see something, reach for it, and grasp it. This is eye-hand coordination and shows motor planning: the brain is directing the body to achieve a goal. Reaching becomes increasingly accurate over the next months.

**What to look for**
- Looking at an object, then reaching for it
- Coordinated reach and grasp
- Adjusting reach mid-movement
- Successful grasping most of the time
- Persistence if first attempt misses
- Preference for certain objects

**Why it matters**

Eye-hand coordination is foundational for all manipulative skills: feeding, dressing, writing, playing. It shows that vision is guiding motor behavior, which is essential for learning about the physical world. Strong reaching skills predict better problem-solving and exploration.

---

#### Reaches/grasps dangling objects (5 months)

**About**

By 5 months, reaching becomes more refined. Babies can reach for and grasp objects that are moving or dangling, which requires more precise timing and coordination. They also start adjusting their grip based on object size and shape.

**What to look for**
- Reaching for moving or dangling objects
- Timing reach to intercept moving objects
- Grasping successfully most of the time
- Adjusting hand opening based on object size
- Persistent reaching if object moves away
- One-handed and two-handed reaches

**Why it matters**

Reaching for moving objects requires predicting where the object will be—this is motor planning and spatial reasoning. It shows sophisticated brain development and sets up skills like catching, playing with toys, and eventually complex motor tasks like sports or playing instruments.

---

#### Interested in small objects (5 months)

**About**

Around 5 months, babies begin noticing and reaching for smaller objects—not just large toys. They're drawn to details, small patterns, and tiny items (watch for choking hazards!). This shows improving visual acuity and fine motor development.

**What to look for**
- Reaching for small objects
- Visual attention to details and small items
- Trying to pick up small things (often raking with whole hand)
- Interest in textures and patterns
- Exploring small features on toys
- Caution: everything goes in mouth—supervise closely

**Why it matters**

Interest in small objects shows improving vision and cognitive development—babies are noticing more details in their world. It also drives fine motor development: trying to pick up small objects refines grasp and hand control. This leads to the pincer grasp (thumb and finger) around 9 months.

---

#### Looks to floor when drops toy (6 months)

**About**

Around 6 months, babies begin understanding object permanence: when something disappears from view, it still exists. If they drop a toy, they'll look down to find it. This is a major cognitive leap and shows memory, prediction, and understanding of physical laws.

**What to look for**
- Looking down when toy is dropped
- Tracking the toy's fall
- Reaching or leaning toward dropped toy
- Repeating the drop to see what happens
- Anticipating where toy will land
- Protesting if toy is out of reach

**Why it matters**

Object permanence is foundational for memory, problem-solving, and understanding cause and effect. It's why babies start "dropping games"—repeatedly dropping toys to see them fall. This play is learning: exploring gravity, permanence, and causality. It also sets up search behaviors, which are crucial for later learning.

---

### GROWTH

#### Continued growth with slowing pace

**About**

Growth during months 3–6 continues steadily but begins to slow slightly from the rapid newborn pace. By 4 months, boys average around 15 lb 7 oz and girls 14 lb 2 oz. By 5 months, boys reach approximately 16 lb 9 oz and girls 15 lb 3 oz. By 6 months, boys typically weigh around 17 lb 8 oz and girls 16 lb 2 oz. Weight gain slows from 5–7 oz/week to about 4–5 oz/week. Babies are developing more muscle tone and body proportions are changing as they become more active with rolling and reaching.

**What to look for**
- Weight gain slowing to 4–5 oz per week (normal and healthy)
- By 4 months: Boys ~15.5 lbs, Girls ~14 lbs
- By 5 months: Boys ~16.5 lbs, Girls ~15 lbs
- By 6 months: Boys ~17.5 lbs, Girls ~16 lbs
- Increasing muscle tone and definition
- Body proportions changing (less "newborn" appearance)
- Continued monitoring at well-baby visits

**Why it matters**

The slowing of growth rate is normal and healthy. Babies are becoming more efficient feeders and more active, which changes how calories are used. Most babies double their birth weight by 4–5 months—a key milestone that healthcare providers track. Continued steady growth (even if slower) indicates healthy development. Tracking growth curves helps identify any concerns early. The physical changes support increasing mobility—rolling, reaching, and eventually sitting.

---

### TEETH

#### First teeth beginning to emerge

**About**

The exciting milestone of first teeth typically occurs during this 4–6 month period, though timing varies widely (some babies teeth earlier or later—both normal). The most common first teeth are the lower central incisors (bottom front teeth), usually appearing around 4–7 months. Teething symptoms may include increased drooling, chewing on hands or objects, irritability, and sore, swollen gums. Some babies experience mild fever or loose stools, though high fevers warrant medical attention.

**What to look for**
- First teeth appearing, typically lower central incisors (4–7 months)
- Increased drooling (may start earlier)
- Chewing on hands, toys, or anything available
- Irritability or fussiness, especially when teeth are moving through gums
- Swollen, tender gums
- Possible mild fever or changes in eating/sleeping
- Some babies show minimal symptoms; others are quite uncomfortable

**Why it matters**

Teething marks an important developmental milestone and the beginning of oral health care. Once teeth appear, dental hygiene becomes critical—wiping teeth with a soft cloth or using a baby toothbrush prevents decay. Understanding normal teething symptoms helps parents provide comfort (cold teething toys, gentle gum massage) and distinguish teething from illness. First teeth also signal readiness for new food textures as babies begin to learn chewing. Wide variation in teething timing is normal—some babies have teeth at 3 months, others not until after 12 months.

---

### VISION

#### Good color vision and depth perception developing

**About**

Vision matures significantly during months 4–6. By 5 months, good color vision has developed—babies can distinguish all colors, though they may still prefer bright, high-contrast patterns. The eyes work together consistently now, supporting the development of depth perception. Babies can track moving objects smoothly across their full visual field and are beginning to develop hand-eye coordination for reaching. Visual memory improves—babies recognize familiar faces across distances and remember objects they've seen before.

**What to look for**
- Good color vision fully developed by 5 months
- Eyes working together consistently (binocular vision)
- Depth perception beginning to develop
- Smooth tracking of moving objects in all directions
- Improved hand-eye coordination (reaching accurately for objects)
- Visual recognition of familiar people and objects
- Sustained visual attention (watching activities, studying toys)

**Why it matters**

Mature color vision and binocular vision are foundational for understanding and navigating the world. Depth perception—understanding distance and three-dimensional space—is critical for reaching, crawling, and later walking. Strong visual tracking supports learning by observation. Hand-eye coordination enables babies to interact with objects, which drives cognitive development. Visual memory supports attachment (recognizing caregivers) and learning (remembering objects and their properties). Any persistent eye crossing, turning, or lack of coordinated movement warrants evaluation.

---

### HEARING

#### Sound localization and vocal experimentation

**About**

Auditory development during months 4–6 includes improved sound localization—babies can accurately turn toward sounds from various directions. They follow sounds with their eyes, seeking the source. Vocal development explodes: babies produce raspberry sounds (blowing air through lips), experiment with volume and pitch, and begin canonical babbling around 6 months ("bababa," "dadada"). They understand "no-no" starting around 4–6 months and show clear responses to emotional tones in voices.

**What to look for**
- Following sounds with eyes (looking for source)
- Making raspberry sounds (4–6 months)
- Beginning to understand "no-no" (pausing or looking when said)
- Babbling with consonant-vowel combinations emerging ("baba," "dada")
- Experimenting with volume, pitch, and different sounds
- Responding differently to happy vs. stern tones
- Turning quickly and accurately toward sounds from all directions

**Why it matters**

Sound localization is essential for safety, learning, and social interaction. It shows the auditory system is maturing and integrating with motor control. The emergence of babbling is a critical language milestone—babies are practicing the sound patterns of their native language. Understanding tone and simple words like "no" shows receptive language development. Vocal experimentation builds the motor patterns needed for speech. If babies don't turn toward sounds consistently or don't vocalize by 6 months, hearing and speech evaluation is recommended.

## 6-9 MONTHS

### GROSS MOTOR SKILLS

#### Gets to sitting position independently (9 months)

**About**

By 9 months, most babies can move themselves into a sitting position without help—typically by pushing up from tummy time or pulling from side-lying. This is true independence and shows strength, coordination, and problem-solving.

**What to look for**
- Moving from lying to sitting without assistance
- Various pathways: from tummy, from side-lying, from back
- Smooth, controlled transitions
- May push up with arms or use legs
- Stable once seated
- Can reverse: sitting back down to lying

**Why it matters**

Independent sitting is a gateway to independence. Babies can now position themselves to play, interact, or rest. It shows advanced motor control, core strength, and spatial awareness. Independent sitting also frees hands for two-handed play and exploration.

---

#### Moves things from one hand to other (9 months)

**About**

By 9 months, hand-to-hand transfer is smooth and frequent. Babies easily shift objects between hands, which allows them to examine objects from all angles and use both hands for complex manipulation. This is bilateral coordination and shows brain integration.

**What to look for**
- Smooth transfer of objects between hands
- Can do this repeatedly
- Transfers objects of various sizes and shapes
- May transfer to examine object from different angles
- Uses freed hand to reach for additional objects
- Both directions of transfer

**Why it matters**

Smooth hand-to-hand transfer is essential for all two-handed activities: holding a bottle while reaching for another toy, clapping, self-feeding with utensils, and later, tasks like buttoning and tying. It shows that the two brain hemispheres are communicating effectively.

---

#### Uses fingers to rake food toward self (9 months)

**About**

Around 9 months, babies use a "raking" grasp to pull small foods toward themselves—fingers together, scraping items into the palm. This is an early self-feeding skill and precursor to the pincer grasp. Babies are motivated by hunger and curiosity to feed themselves.

**What to look for**
- Raking small foods with fingers
- Bringing hand to mouth
- Attempting to feed self (even if messy)
- Interest in finger foods
- Persistence in getting food to mouth
- May transfer food hand to hand

**Why it matters**

Self-feeding is huge for independence, fine motor development, and self-esteem. It shows problem-solving ("I'm hungry, I can fix that") and builds the hand strength and coordination needed for the pincer grasp and eventually utensil use. Messy eating is learning.

---

#### Sits without support (9 months)

**About**

By 9 months, independent sitting is solid. Babies sit stably for extended periods, play with toys while seated, and transition in and out of sitting independently. Balance is good; falling is rare. This frees them to focus on play and social interaction.

**What to look for**
- Sitting independently for 10+ minutes
- Stable, balanced, no propping needed
- Can lean and reach without falling
- Plays with toys while sitting
- Turns to look around without losing balance
- Can sit on various surfaces

**Why it matters**

Independent sitting transforms play and learning. Babies can use both hands, engage with toys more complexly, and interact face-to-face with caregivers. It's also a milestone that signals readiness for high chairs, solid foods, and more complex social interactions.

---

### COMMUNICATION

#### Makes different sounds like "mamama" and "babababa" (9 months)

**About**

By 9 months, babbling is varied and complex. Babies use multiple consonants (m, b, d, g), string syllables together, and vary pitch and rhythm. Babbling sounds increasingly like real speech, complete with "intonation" (speech melody). Some babies may even produce their first recognizable words.

**What to look for**
- Varied consonant-vowel combinations
- Long strings of babbling
- Speech-like intonation and rhythm
- Using babbling communicatively (babbling "at" you)
- Possible first words: "mama," "dada," "baba"
- Practicing sounds during solo play

**Why it matters**

Complex babbling is the final stage before first words. Babies are practicing the sound patterns of their native language, building the motor programs for speech, and learning that sounds have meanings. The more babbling, the richer the language development.

---

#### Lifts arms to be picked up (9 months)

**About**

Around 9 months, babies begin using gestures to communicate. Lifting arms toward a caregiver says "Pick me up!" clearly. This is intentional communication using body language—a huge cognitive and social leap.

**What to look for**
- Raising arms when wanting to be held
- Looking at caregiver while raising arms
- Persistence if not immediately picked up
- Using gesture consistently across contexts
- Other emerging gestures: reaching, pointing
- Combining gestures with vocalizations

**Why it matters**

Gestures are pre-linguistic communication. Babies are learning that they can make their needs known without crying. Gestures predict language development—babies who gesture more develop larger vocabularies earlier. Responding to gestures encourages communication and strengthens attachment.

---

### SOCIAL & EMOTIONAL

#### Shy, clingy, or fearful around strangers (9 months)

**About**

Around 8–9 months, stranger anxiety emerges. Babies who were once happy with anyone now cling to caregivers and show wariness or fear of unfamiliar people. This is healthy and temporary—it shows that babies know who is safe and are cautious about who isn't.

**What to look for**
- Clinging to caregiver when strangers approach
- Crying or fussing with unfamiliar people
- Checking back with caregiver (social referencing)
- Wariness even with familiar people if not seen recently
- Needing time to warm up to new people
- Calming once stranger backs off or leaves

**Why it matters**

Stranger anxiety is a sign of secure attachment and cognitive development (discriminating familiar from unfamiliar). It's protective—babies are learning to be cautious. It usually peaks around 12–15 months and gradually resolves. Forcing interactions makes it worse; allowing babies to warm up at their pace helps.

---

#### Shows several facial expressions (happy, sad, angry, surprised) (9 months)

**About**

By 9 months, babies express a wide range of emotions through facial expressions. They clearly show happiness, sadness, anger, surprise, fear, and disgust. These expressions are increasingly intentional and communicative.

**What to look for**
- Clear, distinct facial expressions
- Expressions matching situations appropriately
- Using expressions to communicate needs
- Reading others' expressions (social referencing)
- Expressions accompanied by appropriate vocalizations
- Expressions that prompt caregiver responses

**Why it matters**

Varied facial expressions show emotional development and social communication. Babies are learning to express internal states and to read others' emotions. This is the foundation of empathy, emotional regulation, and social understanding.

---

#### Looks when you call name (9 months)

**About**

By 9 months, babies consistently respond to their own name. When you call, they look at you—this is name recognition and shows memory, auditory processing, and social awareness. It's also an early indicator of language comprehension.

**What to look for**
- Turning or looking when name is called
- Responding consistently (not just sometimes)
- Responding even when engaged in play
- Distinguishing their name from other similar words
- May respond with smile or vocalization
- Faster response with familiar voices

**Why it matters**

Name recognition is one of the first signs of language comprehension. It shows that babies understand words have meanings and that their name refers to them. It's also essential for safety (responding when called) and social interaction. Lack of name response is an early red flag for hearing issues or developmental concerns.

---

#### Reacts when you leave (clingy) (9 months)

**About**

Around 9 months, separation anxiety intensifies. Babies may cry, cling, or follow when caregivers leave—even just to go to another room. This peaks around 10–18 months and is a normal part of attachment development.

**What to look for**
- Crying when caregiver leaves
- Following or crawling after caregiver
- Protesting loudly when separated
- Difficulty calming without caregiver
- Checking back frequently when playing
- Preferring to stay very close

**Why it matters**

Separation anxiety, while exhausting for parents, is healthy. It shows secure attachment and developing object permanence (understanding that when you leave, you still exist somewhere). Consistent, warm responses—acknowledging feelings while maintaining routines—help babies learn to trust that caregivers always return.

---

#### Smiles/laughs at peek-a-boo (9 months)

**About**

By 9 months, peek-a-boo is hilarious. Babies anticipate the reveal, laugh enthusiastically, and may even initiate the game themselves by covering their own face or yours. This shows object permanence, memory, and humor.

**What to look for**
- Anticipating the "boo!" with smiles or laughter
- Laughing when face is revealed
- Initiating peek-a-boo games
- Playing repeatedly without losing interest
- Variation: hiding objects and finding them
- Shared joy and engagement

**Why it matters**

Peek-a-boo teaches object permanence (you still exist when hidden), builds anticipation and surprise (foundations of humor), and strengthens social bonds through shared laughter. It's also a game babies can start to control, building agency and confidence.

---

### COGNITIVE

#### Bangs two things together (9 months)

**About**

Around 9 months, babies discover they can make noise by banging objects together. This is intentional action, cause-and-effect learning, and early problem-solving. Babies are experimenting with what objects do and how they can control outcomes.

**What to look for**
- Picking up two objects and bringing them together
- Banging repeatedly to make noise
- Pleasure in the sound or outcome
- Experimenting with different objects
- Bilateral coordination (using both hands purposefully)
- May bang objects on surfaces too

**Why it matters**

Banging objects together shows:
- **Bilateral coordination:** Using both hands together purposefully
- **Cause and effect:** "When I bang, it makes noise"
- **Problem-solving:** Figuring out how to produce effects
- **Motor planning:** Coordinating two hands in space

This exploration is foundational for tool use, play skills, and understanding how the physical world works.

---

### GROWTH

#### Steady growth with increasing mobility

**About**

Growth during months 6–9 continues at a steady but slower pace than the early months. By 7 months, boys average around 18 lb 5 oz and girls 16 lb 14 oz. By 8 months, boys reach approximately 19 lbs and girls 17 lb 7 oz. By 9 months, boys typically weigh around 19 lb 10 oz and girls 18 lb 2 oz. As babies become increasingly mobile with crawling and exploring, their body composition changes—more muscle development and less baby fat. Energy expenditure increases significantly with mobility, which affects weight gain patterns.

**What to look for**
- By 7 months: Boys ~18.5 lbs, Girls ~17 lbs
- By 8 months: Boys ~19 lbs, Girls ~17.5 lbs
- By 9 months: Boys ~19.5-20 lbs, Girls ~18 lbs
- Increasing muscle tone from crawling and moving
- Body becoming leaner as mobility increases
- Still gaining weight steadily but at slower pace
- Regular monitoring at well-baby visits

**Why it matters**

The combination of steady growth with increasing mobility shows healthy development. Babies are using calories for both growth and movement, which is why weight gain may plateau slightly during active phases like learning to crawl. Most babies have doubled their birth weight by 5–6 months and are working toward tripling it by their first birthday. The physical changes—stronger muscles, better coordination—support the gross motor milestones of this period. Healthcare providers monitor growth to ensure babies are thriving despite increased activity.

---

### TEETH

#### Upper and lateral incisors emerging

**About**

During months 6–9, more teeth typically appear. After the lower central incisors (usually first, at 4–7 months), the upper central incisors generally emerge around 6–9 months. Later in this period or into the next, the lateral incisors (next to the central ones) may begin appearing around 9–13 months. Most babies have 4–8 teeth by 9 months, though wide variation is normal. Teething symptoms continue: drooling, chewing, irritability, and gum tenderness as each new tooth breaks through.

**What to look for**
- Upper central incisors erupting (6–9 months)
- Lateral incisors may begin toward end of period (9–13 months)
- Most babies have 4–8 visible teeth by 9 months
- Continued teething symptoms: drooling, chewing, fussiness
- Babies may bite while nursing or eating
- Interest in hard foods and teething toys for relief
- Regular dental hygiene increasingly important

**Why it matters**

Multiple teeth allow babies to begin practicing chewing and managing different food textures—an important feeding milestone. Dental care becomes critical once teeth are present: wiping or brushing teeth twice daily prevents decay. Understanding that teething is episodic (symptoms come and go as different teeth emerge) helps parents provide appropriate comfort. The appearance of multiple teeth also signals oral-motor readiness for more varied foods and self-feeding. Wide variation in teething timing is normal and doesn't indicate developmental concerns.

---

### VISION

#### Crawling develops eye-hand-foot-body coordination

**About**

Vision during months 6–9 becomes increasingly sophisticated. By 8 months, crawling helps develop eye-hand-foot-body coordination—babies use vision to navigate, avoid obstacles, and reach destinations. They understand object permanence visually (if something rolls under furniture, they look for it). By 9 months, eye color becomes more permanent, and vision sharpens significantly. Depth perception is well-developed, allowing safe navigation during crawling and cruising.

**What to look for**
- Vision guiding movement during crawling
- Well-developed depth perception (navigating edges, stairs)
- Grasping object permanence (looking for hidden objects)
- Eye color becoming more permanent by 9 months
- Visual acuity improving (noticing small details)
- Coordinated eye-hand-body movements
- Visual problem-solving (figuring out how to reach objects)

**Why it matters**

Vision is now fully integrated with motor planning. Babies use their eyes to navigate space, judge distances, and plan movements—essential for safe crawling and cruising. Object permanence understanding shows cognitive-visual integration. Depth perception prevents falls and injuries as babies become mobile. Visual problem-solving (seeing a toy under furniture and figuring out how to reach it) shows higher-level thinking. Well-developed vision at this stage supports all learning and exploration. Any concerns about eye alignment, tracking, or vision should be evaluated.

---

### HEARING

#### Language comprehension and babbling advancement

**About**

Auditory and language development accelerates during months 6–9. Babies engage in rich babbling—long strings of varied consonant-vowel combinations ("bababa," "dadada," "mamama"). They respond to their name consistently by 9 months. Comprehension grows significantly: babies understand simple words and phrases, follow simple gestures, and may respond to "no." They imitate familiar sounds and produce non-repetitive syllables. Babies try to communicate through gestures combined with vocalizations.

**What to look for**
- Babbling with varied consonant-vowel combinations (7–12 months)
- Responding to own name by 9 months
- Trying to repeat sounds heard
- Imitating familiar sounds and speech patterns
- Producing non-repetitive syllables
- Attempting gestures combined with sounds
- Understanding simple words ("no," "bye-bye")
- Following sounds with eyes and head turns

**Why it matters**

This period is critical for language foundation. Babbling with varied sounds shows babies are practicing the specific sound patterns of their native language. Name recognition is a key comprehension milestone and important for safety. The combination of gestures and vocalizations is intentional communication—babies are expressing needs and wants. Understanding simple words shows receptive language is developing ahead of expressive language. If babies don't respond to their name, don't babble, or don't seem to hear consistently by 9 months, evaluation is recommended.

## 9-12 MONTHS

### GROSS MOTOR SKILLS

#### Pulls up to stand (12 months)

**About**

Around 9–12 months, babies pull themselves up to standing using furniture, crib rails, or caregivers' legs for support. At first they may get stuck standing (not sure how to get back down) and cry for help. Gradually they learn to lower themselves safely.

**What to look for**
- Pulling up on furniture to stand
- Bearing weight on legs while holding on
- Standing for several seconds to minutes
- May "cruise" along furniture (side-stepping while holding on)
- Learning to bend knees and lower back down
- Increasing confidence and speed

**Why it matters**

Pulling to stand is a major motor milestone that shows leg strength, balance, and problem-solving. It's the precursor to cruising and walking. It also changes perspective—standing babies see the world differently and are motivated to explore more. Safety note: Babies who pull up need supervised, baby-proofed spaces.

---

#### Walks holding furniture ("cruising") (12 months)

**About**

Around 10–14 months, babies "cruise"—side-stepping along furniture while holding on for balance. Cruising builds the leg strength, balance, and confidence needed for independent walking, which typically follows within weeks or months.

**What to look for**
- Side-stepping along furniture
- Holding on with one or both hands
- Increasing speed and confidence
- May let go briefly for one or two steps
- Can change direction while cruising
- May cruise to reach toys or people

**Why it matters**

Cruising is the final stage before independent walking. It builds strength in leg and core muscles, refines balance, and teaches weight shifting—all essential for walking. Cruising also expands exploration and independence, motivating further motor development.

---

#### Drinks from cup without lid (12 months)

**About**

Around 12 months, babies can bring an open cup to their mouth and drink without too much spilling (though spills still happen!). This requires hand-eye coordination, motor control, and understanding of how cups work.

**What to look for**
- Grasping cup with one or both hands
- Bringing cup to mouth
- Tilting cup appropriately to drink
- Drinking and swallowing
- Setting cup down (sometimes)
- Decreasing spills over time

**Why it matters**

Drinking from an open cup is a self-care skill that builds independence and fine motor coordination. It's healthier for oral development than prolonged bottle or sippy cup use. Practicing with open cups supports jaw development, speech, and later dental health.

---

#### Pincer grasp (picks things up with thumb and pointer finger) (12 months)

**About**

Around 9–12 months, the pincer grasp emerges: picking up small objects between the thumb and tip of the pointer finger. This is a huge fine motor milestone, enabling precise manipulation of small items and foods.

**What to look for**
- Using thumb and pointer finger to pick up small items
- Precise, controlled grasp
- Picking up tiny foods (Cheerios, peas)
- Exploring small details on toys
- Increasing accuracy and speed
- Using pincer grasp for self-feeding

**Why it matters**

The pincer grasp enables independence in self-feeding, later writing, buttoning, and countless fine motor tasks. It shows sophisticated hand control and brain development. Encouraging pincer grasp through finger foods and small-object play (supervised) supports development.

---

### COMMUNICATION

#### Waves "bye-bye" (12 months)

**About**

Around 10–12 months, babies learn to wave goodbye. This is learned, intentional communication—a gesture with shared social meaning. Babies often wave after someone has already left, but timing improves with practice.

**What to look for**
- Opening and closing hand in a waving motion
- Using wave during departures
- May wave at any goodbye (in person, phone, TV)
- Sometimes waves hello too
- May need prompting at first, then does independently
- Waving accompanied by smiling or vocalizations

**Why it matters**

Waving is symbolic communication: a gesture that represents a concept ("goodbye"). It shows social learning (imitating others), understanding of social routines, and intentional communication. Gestures like waving predict and support spoken language development.

---

#### Calls parent "mama" or "dada" or special name (12 months)

**About**

Around 10–12 months, babies begin using words meaningfully. "Mama" and "dada" start being used to refer to specific people, not just babbled randomly. This is true language—words with meaning used intentionally.

**What to look for**
- Using "mama" or "dada" consistently for specific people
- Saying the word while looking at or reaching for that person
- May have other words: "baba" (bottle), "dog" (dog/animal), "hi," "bye"
- Words may not be perfectly pronounced but are consistent
- Using words to communicate needs or get attention
- First words usually emerge 10–15 months

**Why it matters**

First words are a monumental milestone. They show that babies understand the connection between sounds and meanings, that they can use their voices to communicate complex ideas, and that language is powerful. First words are the beginning of a lifetime of communication.

---

#### Understands "no" (pauses or stops briefly) (12 months)

**About**

Around 10–12 months, babies begin responding to "no." They may pause, look at you, or briefly stop what they're doing (though they might continue after!). This is early language comprehension and shows understanding of social rules.

**What to look for**
- Pausing activity when hearing "no"
- Looking at caregiver when "no" is said
- Brief stopping (may resume after checking your reaction)
- Different response to "no" vs. other words
- Social referencing (checking your face)
- Gradually longer compliance over time

**Why it matters**

Understanding "no" is an early comprehension milestone and shows babies are learning language rules and social expectations. It's essential for safety and discipline. Note: Full impulse control doesn't develop until age 3–4, so repeated redirections are normal and necessary.

---

### SOCIAL & EMOTIONAL

#### Plays games with you (pat-a-cake) (12 months)

**About**

Around 12 months, babies engage in structured social games like pat-a-cake, peek-a-boo, or "so big." They know the routines, anticipate the next steps, and participate actively. This shows memory, social learning, and shared joy.

**What to look for**
- Participating in familiar games
- Anticipating next steps (smiling before the "boo")
- Attempting gestures (clapping for pat-a-cake, raising arms for "so big")
- Initiating games (starting to clap to prompt you)
- Sustained engagement through multiple rounds
- Shared laughter and eye contact

**Why it matters**

Social games build communication, turn-taking, and shared attention. They strengthen bonds through mutual enjoyment and teach babies about routines, expectations, and social interaction rules. Games also support language (associating words with actions) and motor skills (clapping, gestures).

---

### COGNITIVE

#### Puts something in container (12 months)

**About**

Around 12 months, babies start putting objects into containers—blocks in a cup, toys in a box. This is spatial reasoning, fine motor control, and understanding of "containment"—a foundational concept in physics and math.

**What to look for**
- Picking up objects and placing them in containers
- Repeating the action multiple times
- May dump out and refill repeatedly
- Experimenting with different objects and containers
- Understanding that small things fit inside larger things
- Problem-solving when objects don't fit

**Why it matters**

Container play teaches spatial relationships, size concepts (big/small), and cause-and-effect. It builds fine motor skills and problem-solving. Repeated dumping and filling is learning: exploring volume, containment, and object properties. This is foundational for later math and science concepts.

---

#### Looks for things you hide (12 months)

**About**

By 12 months, object permanence is solid. Babies actively search for hidden objects, remember where things were hidden, and can follow multi-step hiding (hiding something in your hand, then in a box). This shows memory, problem-solving, and understanding that objects continue to exist when hidden.

**What to look for**
- Searching for toys hidden under blankets or behind objects
- Lifting blankets or moving obstacles to find objects
- Persistence in searching
- Anticipating where hidden objects are
- Can follow simple hiding sequences
- Protesting or problem-solving if object isn't where expected

**Why it matters**

Object permanence is foundational for memory, problem-solving, and understanding the world. It's why peek-a-boo and hiding games are so important—they teach that disappearance isn't permanent. Strong object permanence predicts better problem-solving and learning abilities.

---

### GROWTH

#### Approaching tripled birth weight

**About**

Growth during months 9–12 continues steadily as babies approach their first birthday. By 10 months, boys average around 20 lb 3 oz and girls 18 lb 11 oz. By 11 months, boys reach approximately 20 lb 12 oz and girls 19 lb 4 oz. By 12 months (first birthday), boys typically weigh around 21 lb 4 oz and girls 19 lb 12 oz. Most babies have tripled their birth weight by their first birthday—a major milestone. Length has increased by about 50% since birth, with babies typically measuring 28–30 inches at 12 months.

**What to look for**
- By 10 months: Boys ~20 lbs, Girls ~19 lbs
- By 11 months: Boys ~21 lbs, Girls ~19.5 lbs
- By 12 months: Boys ~21.5 lbs, Girls ~20 lbs
- Most babies triple birth weight by 12 months
- Length increased by about 50% from birth (typically 28–30 inches)
- Body proportions changing—looking more toddler-like
- Individual variation in size is normal and healthy

**Why it matters**

Tripling birth weight by one year is a standard pediatric milestone that indicates healthy growth and development. The 50% increase in length shows skeletal and muscular development. As babies become walkers, their body composition continues changing—more muscle, less baby fat. Growth patterns during the first year establish trajectories for childhood growth. Healthcare providers use growth charts to ensure babies are following their individual curve, whether that's 10th percentile or 90th—consistency matters more than specific numbers. Significant deviations warrant evaluation.

---

### TEETH

#### First molars and canines beginning

**About**

By 9–12 months, most babies have 6–12 teeth. The lateral incisors (next to the central ones) continue emerging during this period. Looking ahead, first molars typically begin appearing around 13–19 months, and canines (pointed teeth) around 16–22 months. Teething continues to be episodic—periods of discomfort as new teeth push through, followed by relief. The variety of teeth allows babies to practice more sophisticated chewing and manage increasingly complex food textures.

**What to look for**
- Most babies have 6–12 teeth by 12 months
- Lateral incisors completing (9–13 months)
- First molars may begin toward end of period or into next (13–19 months)
- Continued teething symptoms with each new tooth
- Increasing ability to chew various food textures
- Regular dental hygiene essential with multiple teeth
- May bite hard foods and toys for relief

**Why it matters**

Multiple teeth allow toddlers to chew a variety of foods, supporting nutrition and oral-motor development. Chewing practice strengthens jaw muscles used for eating and speech. Dental hygiene becomes increasingly important—brushing twice daily prevents decay. Some parents schedule first dental visits around the first birthday. Understanding ongoing teething helps parents provide comfort and distinguish teething discomfort from illness. Wide variation in number of teeth at 12 months is normal—some babies have only 2 teeth, others have 12.

---

### VISION

#### Vision approaching adult level

**About**

Vision at 9–12 months is approaching adult clarity and sophistication. Babies can see across rooms, recognize people from distances, and judge distances well enough to navigate safely while crawling and cruising. They throw objects with precision, showing excellent hand-eye coordination and depth perception. Visual memory is strong—babies remember where objects are kept and can find favorite toys. Eye color is now set (though may subtly change through early childhood). Visual acuity is sharp enough to notice small details and track fast-moving objects.

**What to look for**
- Seeing and recognizing people across rooms
- Excellent depth perception (navigating stairs, furniture)
- Throwing with precision
- Well-developed eye-hand coordination
- Remembering locations of objects
- Noticing small details and changes in environment
- Tracking fast-moving objects smoothly
- Eye color relatively stable

**Why it matters**

Vision at this level supports all learning and exploration. Babies use vision to navigate independently, learn by observation, and interact with their world. Strong depth perception keeps them safe as they climb and explore. Hand-eye coordination enables fine motor development and tool use. Visual memory supports learning and routines. If vision concerns arise—crossed eyes, lack of visual engagement, unusual eye movements—evaluation is important. Most children should have a comprehensive eye exam between 6–12 months, especially if there's family history of eye problems.

---

### HEARING

#### Following directions and pointing communication

**About**

Auditory development at 9–12 months includes following simple one-step directions, especially when paired with gestures. Babies pay attention to books and toys for 2+ minutes with auditory engagement. They answer questions nonverbally—shaking head for "no," pointing to desired objects. Babies point to objects, pictures, and family members when named. They understand many more words than they can say. Babbling continues to be rich and varied, and first true words typically emerge during this period ("mama," "dada" used meaningfully).

**What to look for**
- Following simple directions with gestures (9–12 months)
- Paying attention to books/toys for 2+ minutes
- Answering questions nonverbally (pointing, shaking head)
- Pointing to objects, pictures, family members when named
- Comprehending many words (receptive vocabulary growing)
- First meaningful words emerging ("mama," "dada," "uh-oh")
- Understanding "no" and pausing when heard
- Responding to name consistently

**Why it matters**

The gap between receptive language (understanding) and expressive language (speaking) is widest now—babies understand far more than they can say. Following directions shows comprehension and cognitive development. Pointing is intentional communication and a strong language predictor. First words are a monumental milestone marking the transition from pre-linguistic to linguistic communication. If babies don't respond to their name, don't understand simple words, or don't attempt communication (gestures or sounds) by 12 months, evaluation is recommended. Early intervention for hearing or language concerns is most effective when started early.

---

## 12-18 MONTHS

### GROSS MOTOR SKILLS

#### Walks independently (14-18 months)

**About**

Between 12 and 18 months, most babies transition from cruising to independent walking. First steps are wobbly and brief, gradually becoming steadier and longer. By 18 months, most toddlers walk confidently across rooms, turn corners, and navigate obstacles.

**What to look for**
- Taking independent steps without holding on
- Increasing number of consecutive steps (from 2–3 to walking across room)
- Arms may be raised for balance at first
- Wide-based gait (feet apart) initially
- Increasing speed, stability, and confidence
- Can walk forward and backward (by 18 months)

**Why it matters**

Walking independently is one of the most celebrated milestones. It transforms exploration, play, and independence. Walking builds leg strength, balance, coordination, and spatial awareness. It also frees hands for carrying objects and more complex play. Safety note: Walking toddlers need careful supervision as falls are common and exploration increases.

---

#### Builds 2-3 cube towers (14-16 months)

**About**

Around 14–18 months, toddlers start stacking blocks or cubes vertically. At first they may stack 2–3 blocks; by 18–24 months, towers of 4–6 blocks are typical. Stacking requires hand-eye coordination, spatial awareness, and fine motor control.

**What to look for**
- Picking up blocks and placing them on top of each other
- Balancing blocks carefully (with increasing precision)
- Towers of 2–3 blocks at 14–16 months, more by 18–24 months
- Rebuilding after towers fall
- Pleasure in building and knocking down
- Experimenting with different arrangements

**Why it matters**

Stacking blocks teaches spatial relationships, balance, cause-and-effect, and problem-solving. It builds hand-eye coordination and fine motor skills. Block play is also foundational for math (concepts like height, more/less, stability) and creativity.

---

#### Climbs on/off couch (18 months)

**About**

By 18 months, toddlers can climb onto furniture like couches or beds, and climb back down (though descent is often less controlled). This shows gross motor strength, coordination, and problem-solving. Safety note: Climbing can be dangerous; supervision and baby-proofing are essential.

**What to look for**
- Pulling up and climbing onto low furniture
- Using arms and legs to hoist body up
- Getting down (may slide feet-first or less safely)
- Persistence if first attempt fails
- Increasing skill and confidence
- May climb on anything climbable

**Why it matters**

Climbing builds gross motor strength, coordination, and spatial awareness. It shows problem-solving (figuring out how to get up and down) and confidence. Climbing also supports brain development—the motor challenges build neural connections. Provide safe climbing opportunities (playgrounds, soft climbers) to support this development.

---

#### Scribbles (18 months)

**About**

Around 18 months, toddlers begin making marks on paper—scribbles that show they understand tools leave traces. These aren't intentional drawings yet, just exploratory marks, but they're the foundation of writing and drawing.

**What to look for**
- Grasping crayon or marker (often whole-hand grasp)
- Making marks on paper
- Random, back-and-forth scribbles
- Sustained interest in marking
- May scribble on many surfaces (walls, tables—supervision needed)
- Pleasure in making marks

**Why it matters**

Scribbling is pre-writing and pre-drawing. It teaches hand control, shows understanding that tools create effects, and is early symbolic thinking (marks represent something). Encouraging scribbling with safe materials supports fine motor development, creativity, and eventual writing skills.

---

#### Drinks from cup, feeds self with fingers, tries spoon (18 months)

**About**

By 18 months, self-feeding skills are developing. Toddlers can drink from open cups with minimal spilling, feed themselves finger foods efficiently, and attempt spoon use (though messy). These are major self-care skills and show independence and motor control.

**What to look for**
- Drinking from open cup without much spilling
- Picking up finger foods with pincer grasp and eating independently
- Grasping spoon and attempting to scoop and bring to mouth
- Food gets to mouth at least some of the time
- Increasing neatness (but still messy—normal)
- Refusing help, wanting to do it independently

**Why it matters**

Self-feeding builds independence, fine motor skills, and self-esteem. It's messy and slow, but essential for development. Allowing toddlers to feed themselves (even imperfectly) supports motor development, autonomy, and healthy eating habits. Resist the urge to take over—the learning is in the practice.

---

### COMMUNICATION

#### Says 1-3 words at a time (14-18 months)

**About**

Between 12 and 18 months, vocabulary expands. By 15 months, many toddlers use 3–5 words consistently; by 18 months, 5–20+ words are typical. Words may be approximations ("ba" for ball) but are used consistently with meaning. There's huge normal variation—some 18-month-olds have 50+ words, others fewer.

**What to look for**
- Using words consistently to label people, objects, or actions
- Words may be simplified but recognizable
- Vocabulary growing over time (adding new words)
- Using words to communicate needs ("milk," "up," "more")
- Understanding far more words than spoken (receptive language)
- Attempting to imitate new words

**Why it matters**

First words mark the beginning of expressive language. Each new word shows cognitive growth (understanding categories), motor learning (producing sounds), and social motivation (communicating). Vocabulary at 18 months predicts later language and reading skills, though late bloomers often catch up.

---

#### Uses loud babble with pointing (14 months)

**About**

Around 14 months, toddlers combine gestures (pointing) with vocalizations to communicate. They point at objects while babbling or saying words, indicating "I want that" or "Look at that!" This is intentional, communicative, and shows understanding that communication involves shared attention.

**What to look for**
- Pointing at objects, people, or interesting things
- Vocalizing while pointing
- Looking between the object and caregiver (checking that you see)
- Persistence if you don't respond
- Pointing to request or share interest
- Using point plus word combinations

**Why it matters**

Pointing is a powerful communication tool and predictor of language development. Toddlers who point frequently develop larger vocabularies and earlier grammar. Pointing shows understanding that others can see what you see and that you can direct their attention—foundations of social communication.

---

#### Tries 1-2 words besides "mama/dada" (15 months)

**About**

By 15 months, vocabulary expands beyond "mama" and "dada" to include other important words—often "no," "hi," "bye," "more," or labels for favorite objects ("ball," "dog," "milk"). These words are used consistently and meaningfully.

**What to look for**
- Using 3–10 words consistently
- Words are meaningful and intentional
- May be approximations ("ba" for bottle)
- Words for familiar people, objects, or actions
- Using words to communicate needs
- Increasing attempts to imitate new words

**Why it matters**

Expanding vocabulary shows language learning is progressing. Each new word represents complex learning: sound production, meaning association, and social use. Responding enthusiastically to word attempts encourages continued language growth.

---

#### Looks at familiar objects when named (15 months)

**About**

By 15 months, receptive language (understanding) far exceeds expressive language (speaking). Toddlers can identify dozens of familiar objects when named: "Where's the ball?" prompts looking or pointing at the ball. This shows word-object association and comprehension.

**What to look for**
- Looking at or pointing to objects when named
- Identifying body parts ("Where's your nose?")
- Responding to names of family members, pets
- Following simple instructions ("Get the ball")
- Understanding routine phrases ("Time for bath")
- Comprehending far more words than spoken

**Why it matters**

Receptive language is the foundation of expressive language. Understanding words comes first, then speaking them. Strong receptive language at 15 months predicts faster expressive language growth. It also allows toddlers to follow directions and engage more fully in social interactions.

---

#### Follows directions with gesture + words (15 months)

**About**

Around 15 months, toddlers follow simple instructions when paired with gestures: "Come here" (while beckoning), "Give me the cup" (while reaching), or "Wave bye-bye." This shows language comprehension and social cooperation.

**What to look for**
- Following simple one-step commands
- Needing gesture support initially (pointing, demonstrating)
- Gradually following verbal-only instructions
- Responding to familiar routines ("Let's go," "Time to eat")
- Compliance isn't perfect (normal for age)
- Shows understanding even if doesn't always comply

**Why it matters**

Following instructions shows language comprehension, memory, and social cooperation. It makes caregiving easier and indicates healthy cognitive and language development. As comprehension grows, toddlers can follow more complex, multi-step instructions.

---

#### Says 3+ words (18 months)

**About**

By 18 months, most toddlers use 5–20+ words consistently (though huge individual variation is normal). Words are increasingly clear and used purposefully to communicate needs, label objects, or share observations. Some toddlers begin combining two words into short phrases.

**What to look for**
- Using 5–20+ words consistently
- Words are labels, requests, or social words
- May combine two words ("more milk," "mama up")
- Attempting to imitate many new words
- Frustration when not understood
- Huge range: some 18-month-olds have 50+ words, others 5–10 (both can be normal)

**Why it matters**

Vocabulary at 18 months is a key language milestone. While there's wide variation (late bloomers often catch up), expanding vocabulary shows language learning is progressing. The number and variety of words predict later language and literacy skills. If vocabulary is limited and not growing, evaluation is recommended.

---

### SOCIAL & EMOTIONAL

#### Parallel play (14 months)

**About**

Around 12–18 months, toddlers engage in "parallel play"—playing alongside other children without direct interaction. They're aware of other children and may imitate or watch, but don't play cooperatively yet. True interactive play emerges later, around 2–3 years.

**What to look for**
- Playing near other children
- Occasionally watching or imitating peers
- Not sharing or taking turns yet
- May play with similar toys nearby
- Interest in other children without direct interaction
- Occasional conflicts over toys

**Why it matters**

Parallel play is the first stage of social play. It shows interest in peers and lays groundwork for cooperative play. Toddlers are learning social skills by observation and proximity. Conflicts over toys are normal and provide learning opportunities for sharing and emotional regulation.

---

#### Frightened by loud noises (14 months)

**About**

Around 12–18 months, toddlers become more aware of potential dangers and may show fear of loud noises, vacuum cleaners, blenders, or thunder. This is healthy caution and shows developing understanding of the world.

**What to look for**
- Startling or crying at loud noises
- Seeking comfort from caregivers
- Covering ears or moving away
- Remembering feared objects and avoiding them
- Gradual desensitization with repeated exposure
- Using caregiver reactions to gauge safety (social referencing)

**Why it matters**

Fear responses show cognitive development (remembering past experiences, anticipating outcomes) and self-protection. Healthy fear keeps toddlers safe. Responding with comfort and reassurance teaches emotional regulation and builds secure attachment. Toddlers learn "That's scary, but I'm safe with you."

---

#### Wants attention/praise (14 months)

**About**

Around 12–18 months, toddlers actively seek caregiver attention and approval. They bring you toys, show you things, perform for applause, and check your reaction frequently. This is healthy attachment and motivation to learn.

**What to look for**
- Bringing objects to show you
- Looking for your reaction after accomplishments
- Repeating actions that get praise or laughter
- Saying or signing "Look!"
- Pride in new skills
- Seeking reassurance when uncertain

**Why it matters**

Seeking attention and praise shows secure attachment and social motivation. Toddlers learn through social feedback—your enthusiasm motivates them to try new things and persist through challenges. Positive attention builds self-esteem, confidence, and emotional security.

---

#### Reacts to routine changes (14 months)

**About**

Toddlers thrive on predictable routines and may become upset when routines change—different bedtime, new caregiver, or unexpected events. This shows memory, expectation, and the security routines provide.

**What to look for**
- Protest or upset when routines change
- Anticipating next steps in familiar routines
- Calmer with predictable schedules
- Difficulty with transitions
- Seeking comfort during changes
- Gradually adapting to new routines

**Why it matters**

Routines provide security and help toddlers predict what's coming—reducing anxiety. Reaction to changes shows memory and expectation. While flexibility is good long-term, predictable routines during toddlerhood support emotional security and cooperation. Preparing toddlers for changes ("After lunch, we're going to...") helps transitions.

---

#### Self-soothes (14 months)

**About**

Around 12–18 months, toddlers begin developing self-soothing skills—sucking thumb, holding lovey, rocking, or seeking comfort objects. This is early emotional regulation and shows increasing independence.

**What to look for**
- Using comfort objects (blanket, stuffed animal)
- Thumb or pacifier for comfort
- Seeking quiet space when overwhelmed
- Calming self after minor upsets
- Still needs caregiver for big emotions
- Increasing ability to wait briefly

**Why it matters**

Self-soothing is foundational for emotional regulation. Toddlers who can calm themselves slightly are building skills for managing bigger emotions later. This doesn't mean they don't need comfort—caregiver support is still essential—but self-soothing shows growing emotional maturity and coping skills.

---

#### Copies other children (15 months)

**About**

Around 15–18 months, toddlers actively imitate peers. If one child climbs, others follow. If one picks up a ball, others grab balls. This is social learning and shows interest in and awareness of other children.

**What to look for**
- Watching and imitating peers
- Following when another child runs or moves
- Copying actions or play styles
- Laughing when other children laugh
- Parallel play with similar activities
- Increasingly interested in other children

**Why it matters**

Imitating peers is powerful social learning. Toddlers learn new skills, behaviors, and play ideas from each other. This imitation is foundational for cooperative play, social rules, and empathy. It also shows cognitive development—observing, remembering, and reproducing actions.

---

#### Shows affection (15 months)

**About**

Around 15–18 months, toddlers express affection clearly: hugs, kisses, patting, cuddling, or resting head on caregiver. These are intentional expressions of love and connection.

**What to look for**
- Spontaneous hugs and kisses
- Cuddling during story time or calm moments
- Patting or stroking caregivers gently
- Seeking closeness and physical contact
- Showing affection to favorite people, pets, or toys
- Affection may be exuberant (squeezing hard)

**Why it matters**

Expressing affection shows secure attachment and emotional development. Toddlers are learning to express love and connection, building social and emotional skills. Affectionate toddlers are developing empathy and understanding of relationships. Receiving and returning affection strengthens bonds and supports emotional health.

---

#### Claps when excited (15 months)

**About**

Around 15 months, toddlers clap spontaneously when happy, excited, or proud. Clapping shows they've learned a social gesture and use it to express and share emotions.

**What to look for**
- Clapping when happy or excited
- Clapping to celebrate accomplishments
- Clapping during songs or games
- Clapping to prompt caregiver participation
- May stomp feet or jump while clapping
- Shared joy during clapping

**Why it matters**

Clapping is social, emotional, and motor. It shows gesture learning (communication), emotional expression (sharing joy), and bilateral coordination (using both hands together). Clapping also invites others into the experience—it's inherently social and builds connection.

---

#### Pretend play begins (16 months)

**About**

Around 16–18 months, early pretend play emerges: pretending to drink from empty cup, "feeding" dolls or stuffed animals, or putting phone to ear. This is symbolic thinking—understanding that one thing can represent another—and a major cognitive leap.

**What to look for**
- Pretending to eat, drink, sleep, or talk on phone
- "Feeding" dolls or stuffed animals
- Using objects symbolically (block as phone)
- Imitating familiar routines (cooking, cleaning)
- Simple, repetitive pretend scenarios
- Pleasure in pretend play

**Why it matters**

Pretend play is a huge cognitive milestone. It shows symbolic thinking, memory (remembering routines), and creativity. Pretend play supports language (practicing social scripts), emotional development (trying out roles and emotions), and problem-solving. It's foundational for later complex play, imagination, and abstract thinking.

---

#### Enjoys praise (16 months)

**About**

By 16–18 months, toddlers clearly seek and enjoy praise. They repeat actions that get applause, show pride in accomplishments, and beam at positive feedback. Praise is motivating and shapes behavior.

**What to look for**
- Repeating actions that get praise
- Smiling or clapping after accomplishments
- Looking for caregiver reactions
- Pride in new skills ("I did it!")
- Seeking attention for successes
- May say "Yay!" or clap for themselves

**Why it matters**

Enjoying praise shows social motivation and self-awareness. Praise shapes learning: toddlers are motivated to master skills and behave positively when efforts are noticed. Specific, genuine praise ("You stacked those blocks so carefully!") builds self-esteem, persistence, and intrinsic motivation.

#### Upset when doesn't get way (16 months)

**About**

Around 16–18 months, toddlers have strong desires and limited emotional regulation. When they don't get what they want—immediate snack, continued play, forbidden object—they may have meltdowns. This is normal and shows growing independence and awareness of wants.

**What to look for**
- Tantrums when denied or frustrated
- Screaming, crying, or throwing self down
- Difficulty calming quickly
- Strong reactions to small frustrations
- Testing limits and boundaries
- Needs help regulating big emotions

**Why it matters**

Tantrums are developmentally normal. Toddlers have big emotions and small regulation skills. Your calm, consistent responses teach emotional regulation over time. Tantrums aren't manipulation—they're overwhelm. Toddlers need empathy, boundaries, and help learning to cope with disappointment. This is foundational emotional learning.

---

#### Moves away but checks you're close (18 months)

**About**

Around 18 months, toddlers explore more independently but frequently check back: looking at caregiver, returning periodically, or calling out. This is "secure base" behavior—using caregiver as a safe home base for exploration.

**What to look for**
- Wandering away to explore
- Frequently looking back at caregiver
- Returning periodically for connection
- Protesting if caregiver is out of sight
- Balancing independence and connection
- Increasing confidence in exploration

**Why it matters**

Checking back shows secure attachment. Toddlers feel safe to explore because they know caregiver is available. This balance of independence and connection is healthy and predicts confidence, resilience, and social skills. Being a secure base—available but not hovering—supports optimal development.

---

#### Points to show interest (18 months)

**About**

By 18 months, pointing is frequent and intentional. Toddlers point to share interest ("Look at that dog!"), request ("I want that"), or ask questions (pointing with questioning face). Pointing shows understanding that communication involves shared attention.

**What to look for**
- Pointing at objects of interest
- Looking between object and caregiver
- Using different point types: showing, requesting, asking
- Pointing accompanied by vocalizations or words
- Persistent pointing if no response
- Responding to others' points

**Why it matters**

Pointing is critical for language and social development. It shows joint attention (sharing focus), social communication (understanding others have minds), and intentionality. Toddlers who point frequently develop language faster. Responding to points ("Yes, that's a bird!") supports language growth.

---

#### Helps dress self (18 months)

**About**

Around 18 months, toddlers start participating in dressing: pushing arms through sleeves, lifting feet for shoes, pulling off socks. They can't dress independently yet, but they help and show interest in self-care.

**What to look for**
- Pushing arms into sleeves
- Pulling off hat, socks, or shoes
- Lifting feet for shoes or pants
- Attempting to pull up pants
- Interest in helping
- Frustration when can't do it alone

**Why it matters**

Helping with dressing builds fine and gross motor skills, independence, and self-esteem. It shows understanding of routines and desire for autonomy. Allowing toddlers to help (even when it's slower) supports development and confidence. Skills grow rapidly with practice.

---

### COGNITIVE

#### Puts 2 cubes in 1 hand to hold 3rd (14 months)

**About**

Around 14 months, toddlers solve spatial problems like holding multiple objects. They might put two blocks in one hand to free the other hand to pick up a third. This is problem-solving, spatial reasoning, and planning.

**What to look for**
- Holding two objects in one hand
- Adjusting grip to accommodate multiple items
- Problem-solving when hands are full
- Trying different strategies
- Successfully holding multiple objects
- Using one hand to free the other

**Why it matters**

This shows advanced problem-solving: recognizing a problem (hands full), planning a solution (consolidating objects), and executing it. It requires spatial awareness, fine motor control, and executive function. These are foundational cognitive skills that support all future learning.

---

#### Uses things right way (15 months)

**About**

Around 15–18 months, toddlers use objects functionally: brushing hair with brush, "talking" on phone, putting spoon to mouth. This shows understanding of object purpose and symbolic thinking.

**What to look for**
- Using objects for their intended purpose
- Brushing hair, pretending to eat, "talking" on phone
- Imitating adult actions
- Understanding tool use
- Matching object to function
- Pretend play incorporating functional use

**Why it matters**

Functional object use shows cognitive development: understanding that objects have purposes, memory (recalling how objects are used), and imitation. It's foundational for pretend play, tool use, and problem-solving. Encouraging functional play supports cognitive and language development.

---

#### Stacks 2+ objects (15 months)

**About**

By 15 months, toddlers can stack 2–3 objects (blocks, cups, rings). This requires hand-eye coordination, balance, spatial awareness, and understanding of stability. Stacking is problem-solving in action.

**What to look for**
- Stacking 2–3 blocks vertically
- Careful placement for balance
- Rebuilding after towers fall
- Experimenting with different objects
- Pleasure in building and knocking down
- Increasing height over time

**Why it matters**

Stacking teaches spatial relationships, balance, cause-and-effect (why towers fall), and problem-solving. It builds hand-eye coordination and fine motor skills. Stack play is foundational for math (concepts like height, stability, more/less) and physics understanding.

---

#### Looks for hidden toys (16 months)

**About**

By 16 months, object permanence is advanced. Toddlers search for hidden objects, remember where things were left, and can follow multi-step hiding. This shows memory, problem-solving, and understanding that objects exist even when hidden.

**What to look for**
- Actively searching for hidden toys
- Remembering where objects were placed
- Lifting covers or moving obstacles
- Persistence in searching
- Anticipating locations
- Problem-solving if object isn't where expected

**Why it matters**

Strong object permanence supports memory, problem-solving, and understanding of the physical world. It's essential for learning, play, and safety (knowing that things exist even when not visible). Object permanence games support cognitive development.

---

#### Enjoys textured books (16 months)

**About**

Around 15–18 months, toddlers love books with textures, flaps, or interactive elements. They explore tactilely, lift flaps, and engage with books as active objects. This builds pre-literacy skills and sensory learning.

**What to look for**
- Touching textured elements in books
- Lifting flaps
- Sustained interest in books
- Pointing at pictures
- Imitating book-related actions (turning pages)
- Requesting favorite books

**Why it matters**

Early book engagement builds pre-literacy skills: understanding that books tell stories, that pictures represent objects, and that reading is enjoyable. Textured books support sensory learning and keep young toddlers engaged. Regular book reading predicts language and literacy development.

---

#### Knows what ordinary things are for (18 months)

**About**

By 18 months, toddlers understand the purpose of common objects: cups are for drinking, brushes for hair, spoons for eating. This is conceptual knowledge and shows memory, categorization, and functional understanding.

**What to look for**
- Using objects appropriately
- Recognizing objects by function ("Where's the cup?")
- Understanding action words (eat, brush, drink)
- Functional pretend play
- Matching objects to contexts (knowing hairbrush belongs in bathroom)
- Generalization (recognizing different types of cups)

**Why it matters**

Understanding object functions shows cognitive development: categorization, memory, and conceptual thinking. It's foundational for language (words represent categories), problem-solving (using tools), and daily functioning (self-care skills). This knowledge supports independence and learning.

---

### GROWTH

#### Toddler proportions developing

**About**

Growth during months 12–18 continues but at a noticeably slower pace than infancy. By 15 months, boys average around 22 lb 11 oz and girls 21 lb 3 oz. By 18 months, boys typically weigh around 24 lb 1 oz and girls 22 lb 8 oz. The dramatic growth rate of the first year has slowed significantly—this is normal and healthy. Toddlers are developing more mature body proportions: longer legs, less prominent belly, more defined muscles from constant movement. Appetites may seem smaller or erratic as growth slows, which worries some parents but is developmentally appropriate.

**What to look for**
- By 15 months: Boys ~23 lbs, Girls ~21 lbs
- By 18 months: Boys ~24 lbs, Girls ~22.5 lbs
- Growth rate slowing significantly from first year
- Body proportions changing—less "baby" appearance
- Developing toddler physique with longer limbs
- Appetite may fluctuate as growth slows
- Individual variation in size remains normal

**Why it matters**

The slowing growth rate is healthy and expected—toddlers don't need the rapid growth of infancy. Energy goes toward development, learning, and constant physical activity rather than just growing. Healthcare providers track growth velocity (rate of change) more than absolute numbers—steady growth along a percentile curve is what matters. Erratic eating is common and normal; offering nutritious options and trusting appetite cues supports healthy eating patterns. Body proportion changes support new motor skills like walking, running, and climbing.

---

### TEETH

#### First molars and canines erupting

**About**

During months 12–18, significant teething continues. First molars typically erupt around 13–19 months—these are larger, flat teeth in the back used for grinding food. Canines (pointed "eye teeth") begin appearing around 16–23 months. These teeth are often more uncomfortable than earlier teeth because they're larger and break through thicker gum tissue. Most toddlers have 12–16 teeth by 18 months. The variety of teeth allows more sophisticated chewing and food texture management.

**What to look for**
- First molars erupting (13–19 months), often more uncomfortable
- Canines beginning (16–23 months)
- Most have 12–16 teeth by 18 months
- Increased teething discomfort with larger teeth
- Greater ability to chew various foods
- Regular brushing twice daily essential
- First dental visit recommended by 12–18 months

**Why it matters**

Molars enable true grinding and chewing, allowing toddlers to manage adult food textures safely. Canines help tear food. The variety of teeth supports nutrition and oral-motor development. Dental hygiene is critical—cavities can form quickly once multiple teeth are present. First dental visits establish positive relationships with dental care and allow early problem detection. Understanding that molar teething is often more intense helps parents provide appropriate comfort. Some toddlers experience sleep disruption, appetite changes, or increased irritability during molar eruption.

---

### VISION

#### Vision approaching adult clarity

**About**

Vision during months 12–18 continues refining and approaching adult levels. Toddlers recognize and point to pictures in books, showing visual memory and comprehension. They can identify familiar people and objects from photographs. Visual attention span increases—toddlers can sustain focus on books, activities, or observations. Hand-eye coordination supports fine motor tasks like stacking blocks, using utensils, and drawing. Color recognition may emerge during this period.

**What to look for**
- Recognizing people and objects in photographs
- Pointing to pictures in books when named
- Sustained visual attention to activities (5–10 minutes)
- Accurate hand-eye coordination for fine motor tasks
- Beginning color recognition (naming comes later)
- Visual memory for locations and routines
- Watching and learning from observation

**Why it matters**

Mature vision supports all learning and daily functioning. Visual memory helps toddlers learn routines and find desired objects. Picture recognition is a pre-literacy skill—understanding that two-dimensional images represent three-dimensional reality. Hand-eye coordination enables increasing independence in feeding, dressing, and play. Vision guides safe navigation as toddlers climb, run, and explore. Any persistent vision concerns warrant evaluation to ensure visual development is on track.

---

### HEARING

#### Vocabulary expanding and following simple commands

**About**

Auditory and language development accelerates dramatically during months 12–18. Vocabulary expands from a few words to 20–50+ words by 18 months, though huge individual variation is normal. Toddlers follow simple one-step commands, especially with gestures: "Get your shoes," "Come here," "Give me the cup." They understand far more words than they can say (receptive vocabulary of 100–200+ words). Simple songs and rhymes are enjoyed and anticipated.

**What to look for**
- Following simple one-step commands (with gesture support)
- Vocabulary expanding (3–50+ words by 18 months, huge variation normal)
- Understanding far exceeds speaking ability
- Recognizing names of familiar people, objects, body parts
- Enjoying songs, rhymes, finger plays
- Pointing to communicate wants and share interest
- Attempting to imitate new words

**Why it matters**

This period is critical for language foundation. The vocabulary explosion that typically occurs around 18–24 months is set up by the word learning of this period. Following commands shows comprehension and cognitive development. The gap between receptive and expressive language is widest now, which can be frustrating for toddlers—they understand much more than they can communicate, leading to tantrums. Supporting language development through talking, reading, singing, and responding to communication attempts accelerates growth. If a toddler isn't using any words or following simple commands by 18 months, evaluation is recommended.

## 18-24 MONTHS

### GROSS MOTOR SKILLS

#### Walks upstairs holding hand (20 months)

**About**

Around 18–20 months, toddlers begin walking up stairs while holding an adult's hand or the railing. They typically lead with one foot and bring the other to meet it on the same step (marking time), rather than alternating feet. This shows growing leg strength, balance, and spatial awareness. By 24 months, many can walk upstairs more confidently, though alternating feet usually comes later (around 3–4 years).

**What to look for**
- Walking upstairs while holding your hand or railing
- Bringing both feet to each step before proceeding (not alternating)
- May need encouragement or pause between steps
- Watching feet placement carefully
- Increasing confidence and speed over time
- Descending stairs is usually harder and comes later

**Why it matters**

Stair climbing builds leg strength, balance, and spatial reasoning. It shows that toddlers can plan multi-step movements and navigate three-dimensional space. This skill supports all gross motor development and builds confidence in physical capabilities. Safety note: Always supervise stairs; falls are common as toddlers learn.

---

#### Stacks 3-6 blocks (20 months)

**About**

By 20 months, tower-building skills advance significantly. Toddlers can stack 3–6 blocks vertically with increasing precision and stability. This requires fine motor control, hand-eye coordination, spatial awareness, and understanding of balance and gravity.

**What to look for**
- Stacking 3–6 blocks into stable towers
- Careful, controlled placement
- Adjusting for balance if tower wobbles
- Rebuilding after towers fall
- Pleasure in building taller structures
- Experimenting with different block arrangements

**Why it matters**

Block stacking teaches spatial relationships, balance, physics (gravity, stability), and problem-solving. It builds fine motor skills and hand-eye coordination. Block play is foundational for STEM learning—concepts like height, weight distribution, and structural stability are being explored through play.

---

#### Turns book pages (20 months)

**About**

Around 18–20 months, toddlers develop the fine motor control to turn individual book pages rather than grabbing several at once. This shows improved finger dexterity, gentleness of touch, and understanding of how books work.

**What to look for**
- Turning pages one at a time (most of the time)
- Using finger or whole hand
- May still grab multiple pages occasionally
- Interested in books and page-turning
- May turn pages back and forth to find favorite pictures
- Increasing control and precision over time

**Why it matters**

Page-turning is a fine motor skill that shows finger control and gentle manipulation. It's also a pre-literacy skill—understanding that books progress page by page, that pages turn a specific direction, and that each page contains information. Independent page-turning allows toddlers to engage with books more actively.

---

#### Jumps (24 months)

**About**

Around 20–24 months, toddlers learn to jump—getting both feet off the ground briefly. Early jumps are more like enthusiastic stomps; true jumping (with flight time) usually emerges closer to 24–30 months. This requires leg strength, coordination, balance, and understanding of how to propel the body upward.

**What to look for**
- Both feet leaving the ground simultaneously
- May jump from low steps or curbs before jumping on flat ground
- Landing with both feet (often with a thump)
- Arms swinging for momentum
- Increasing height and control over time
- Jumping repeatedly with delight

**Why it matters**

Jumping is a complex motor skill that integrates strength, coordination, timing, and balance. It builds leg and core muscles, spatial awareness, and confidence in physical abilities. Jumping is also joyful—it's one of the first ways toddlers experience the sensation of flight, which is thrilling and motivating.

---

#### Kicks ball (24 months)

**About**

By 24 months, most toddlers can kick a ball forward while walking or standing. Early kicks are often toe-pokes or whole-leg swings rather than controlled soccer-style kicks, but the intention and basic coordination are there. This shows leg strength, balance (standing on one leg briefly), and hand-eye (or foot-eye) coordination.

**What to look for**
- Walking into or kicking a stationary ball
- Ball moves forward when kicked
- May lose balance initially
- Increasing accuracy and power over time
- Delight in making the ball move
- Can follow and kick ball repeatedly

**Why it matters**

Kicking requires standing on one leg briefly while swinging the other—sophisticated balance and coordination. It teaches cause-and-effect (my action moves the ball), spatial awareness (direction, distance), and motor planning. Ball skills support later sports participation and physical confidence.

---

#### Throws ball (24 months)

**About**

By 24 months, toddlers can throw a ball forward using an overhand or underhand motion. Early throws are often stiff-armed and imprecise, but the basic pattern is there. Accuracy and power improve dramatically over the next years. Throwing requires arm strength, hand-eye coordination, and understanding of trajectory.

**What to look for**
- Releasing ball so it travels forward
- May use overhand or underhand throw
- Often stiff-armed or whole-body motion
- Direction is approximate
- Increasing distance and accuracy over time
- Can throw to a person or target (even if misses)

**Why it matters**

Throwing integrates arm strength, coordination, timing (when to release), and spatial understanding (trajectory). It's foundational for all ball sports and play. Throwing also teaches physics concepts like force, distance, and arc. Early throwing practice builds motor skills and confidence.

---

#### Makes "train" with cubes (24 months)

**About**

Around 24 months, toddlers begin arranging blocks or cubes horizontally in lines—making "trains" or "roads." This is different from vertical stacking and shows spatial reasoning, planning, and emerging symbolic play (the line represents something).

**What to look for**
- Lining up blocks in rows
- May push the "train" while making sounds
- Deliberate arrangement (not random)
- Can make trains of varying lengths
- May name creation ("train," "road," "snake")
- Combines with other play (adding toy cars or figures)

**Why it matters**

Creating horizontal patterns shows spatial thinking and planning. It's early symbolic play (blocks represent something else) and shows understanding of sequences and order. This type of constructive play supports STEM learning, creativity, and fine motor skills.

---

#### Copies vertical line (24 months)

**About**

Around 24 months, toddlers can copy a vertical line after watching you draw one. This shows fine motor control, visual-motor integration (seeing and reproducing), and understanding that marks have meaning. This is a step beyond random scribbling toward intentional mark-making.

**What to look for**
- Making a roughly vertical mark after demonstration
- Doesn't need to be perfectly straight
- Shows intention to copy
- May need hand-over-hand help initially
- Increasing accuracy over time
- Interest in making marks and copying

**Why it matters**

Copying lines is pre-writing. It shows that toddlers understand marks are purposeful and can be reproduced. It builds fine motor control, hand-eye coordination, and visual processing. Copying shapes is a developmental sequence (vertical line, then horizontal, then circle) that leads to letter and number formation.

---

#### Runs (24 months)

**About**

By 24 months, walking transitions to running—a true "flight phase" where both feet are off the ground briefly. Early running is stiff and flat-footed, but the basic pattern is there. Running speed, smoothness, and endurance improve dramatically over the next years.

**What to look for**
- True flight phase (both feet off ground)
- Faster than walking
- May run stiffly or flat-footed initially
- Arms pumping
- Increasing speed, coordination, and smoothness over time
- Delight in the sensation of speed

**Why it matters**

Running is a major gross motor milestone that shows strength, coordination, and cardiovascular endurance. It allows toddlers to explore more extensively, engage in active play, and experience the joy of speed and movement. Running also supports overall health, motor development, and confidence.

---

### COMMUNICATION

#### Points to body parts (20 months)

**About**

Around 18–20 months, toddlers can identify and point to major body parts when asked: "Where's your nose? Where are your eyes?" This shows language comprehension, body awareness, and the ability to follow verbal instructions.

**What to look for**
- Pointing to named body parts on self or others
- Can identify 3–6 body parts by 20 months (nose, eyes, mouth, ears, belly, hair)
- Responds reliably when asked
- May name body parts ("nose!" while pointing)
- Increasing number of body parts over time
- Can point on dolls, pictures, or people

**Why it matters**

Body part identification shows vocabulary growth, comprehension, and body awareness. It's also a safety skill (can show where it hurts) and supports later self-care (washing hands, brushing teeth). Understanding body parts is foundational for health literacy and communication about physical needs.

---

#### Uses 15-20 words (20 months)

**About**

By 20 months, most toddlers use 15–25 words consistently (though huge individual variation is normal). Words are increasingly clear and used purposefully to label, request, or comment. Receptive vocabulary (words understood) far exceeds expressive vocabulary (words spoken).

**What to look for**
- Using 15–25+ single words consistently
- Mix of nouns (ball, milk), verbs (go, eat), social words (hi, bye), and names
- Words may be approximations but recognizable
- Attempting to imitate new words
- Using words to communicate needs
- Frustration when not understood (signals need for more words)

**Why it matters**

Vocabulary at 20 months predicts language development and later literacy. While there's wide normal variation (some 20-month-olds have 5 words, others 50+), vocabulary should be growing steadily. If vocabulary is limited and not expanding, evaluation is recommended. Each new word represents complex learning: sound production, meaning, and social use.

---

#### Tries 2-word phrases (20 months)

**About**

Around 18–20 months, some toddlers begin combining two words into short phrases: "more milk," "mama up," "bye-bye doggy." This is the beginning of grammar and shows understanding that words can be combined to create more complex meaning. Many toddlers don't combine words until closer to 24 months—both are normal.

**What to look for**
- Putting two words together meaningfully
- Common combinations: more + noun, name + action, modifier + noun
- May be inconsistent—sometimes two words, sometimes single words
- Showing understanding that combinations add meaning
- Increasing frequency over time
- May still use mostly single words (normal)

**Why it matters**

Two-word combinations are the birth of grammar. They show that toddlers understand words relate to each other and that combinations create new meanings. This is a huge cognitive leap that sets up sentences, complex language, and eventually conversation. It also makes communication more effective and reduces frustration.

---

#### Understands yes/no questions (20 months)

**About**

By 20 months, toddlers understand simple yes/no questions: "Do you want milk?" "Is this your shoe?" They may nod, shake head, or answer verbally ("yeah," "no"). This shows comprehension of question structure and the concept of binary choice.

**What to look for**
- Responding appropriately to yes/no questions
- May nod, shake head, say "yes/yeah/uh-huh" or "no/nuh-uh"
- Understanding doesn't always mean compliance ("Do you want bath?" "No!" but it's bath time anyway)
- Accurate responses most of the time
- May answer "no" to everything (normal phase)
- Using yes/no themselves in appropriate contexts

**Why it matters**

Understanding yes/no questions shows language comprehension, conceptual thinking (yes vs. no), and the ability to express preferences. It makes communication more efficient and allows toddlers to participate in decision-making. It's also foundational for later understanding of questions, negation, and complex grammar.

---

#### Says 2-3 word sentences (24 months)

**About**

By 24 months, many toddlers consistently use 2–3 word sentences: "I want milk," "Daddy go car," "More book please." Grammar isn't perfect—articles, plurals, and word endings are often missing—but the basic sentence structure is there. This is the foundation of conversational language.

**What to look for**
- Using 2–3 word combinations regularly
- Subject-verb or verb-object combinations ("I go," "want cookie")
- May include modifiers ("big truck," "my ball")
- Grammar imperfect but meaning clear
- Increasing length and complexity over time
- Using sentences to communicate needs, observations, and requests

**Why it matters**

Short sentences are true language. Toddlers are now expressing complex ideas, relationships, and requests. This dramatically reduces frustration and increases connection. Sentence length is a key language milestone—it predicts later language ability and literacy. Encouraging longer utterances through modeling and expansion supports growth.

---

#### Refers to self by name (24 months)

**About**

Around 24 months, toddlers begin using their own name to refer to themselves: "Emma want juice," "Tommy go outside." Pronouns like "I" and "me" usually emerge around the same time or slightly later. This shows self-awareness and understanding that they are separate individuals with their own identity.

**What to look for**
- Using own name in sentences ("Sarah want milk")
- May start using "me" ("Me do it!")
- Beginning to use "I" (usually 24–30 months)
- Clear self-reference (knowing the name refers to them)
- May answer "Who's that?" while pointing at self in mirror with own name
- Shows understanding of self as distinct person

**Why it matters**

Self-reference shows self-awareness and identity formation—huge cognitive and social milestones. Understanding "I am a person with a name" is foundational for sense of self, independence, and social relationships. It's also a language milestone showing understanding of pronouns and reference.

---

#### Has 50+ words (24 months)

**About**

By 24 months, typical expressive vocabulary is 50–300+ words (huge range is normal). The "50-word milestone" is significant because it often precedes a language explosion—rapid vocabulary growth and word combinations. Toddlers understand far more words than they can say.

**What to look for**
- Using 50+ different words over time
- Mix of nouns, verbs, adjectives, social words
- Rapidly adding new words (sometimes several per week)
- Attempting to imitate many new words
- Using words across contexts (not just memorized phrases)
- Individual variation is enormous (normal range 20–300+ words)

**Why it matters**

Vocabulary size at 24 months strongly predicts later language, literacy, and academic success. The "50-word threshold" often triggers a vocabulary explosion and increased word combinations. While late bloomers often catch up, limited vocabulary that isn't growing warrants evaluation. Rich language input (reading, conversation, narrating) supports vocabulary growth.

---

#### Plays pretend (24 months)

**About**

By 24 months, pretend play becomes more complex and frequent. Toddlers engage in elaborate scenarios: feeding dolls, cooking pretend food, having tea parties, talking on toy phones, or pretending to drive cars. This is symbolic thinking—using imagination to represent reality—and shows cognitive sophistication.

**What to look for**
- Engaging in pretend scenarios regularly
- Using toys and objects symbolically (block as phone, stick as spoon)
- Imitating adult activities (cooking, cleaning, caring for baby)
- Simple storylines emerging
- May narrate play ("Baby hungry, feed baby")
- Can sustain pretend play for several minutes
- May involve others in play

**Why it matters**

Pretend play is crucial for cognitive, social, and emotional development. It shows abstract thinking, memory (recalling routines), creativity, and understanding of others' perspectives. Pretend play supports language (practicing conversations), emotional regulation (working through feelings), and problem-solving. It's one of the most important types of play for development.

---

#### Understands "big/small/in" (24 months)

**About**

By 24 months, toddlers understand basic spatial and size concepts: big vs. small, in vs. out, up vs. down, on vs. off. They can follow instructions using these concepts ("Put the block in the cup," "Get the big ball") and may start using the words themselves.

**What to look for**
- Following instructions with spatial/size words
- Identifying big vs. small objects when asked
- Using concepts in speech ("In there!" "Big truck!")
- Understanding positional words (in, on, under, up, down)
- Showing understanding through actions even if not saying words yet
- Beginning to compare sizes

**Why it matters**

Understanding concepts like size and spatial relationships is foundational for math, science, and spatial reasoning. These concepts support problem-solving, following complex instructions, and describing the world. They're also essential for safety (understanding "up high" or "in the street") and daily functioning.

---

#### Half of speech understandable (24 months)

**About**

By 24 months, about 50% of toddler speech should be understandable to unfamiliar listeners (not just parents). Words may not be perfectly pronounced, but strangers can catch the gist of what's being said. Speech clarity improves dramatically over the next years.

**What to look for**
- Strangers can understand roughly half of words/sentences
- Parents understand much more (75–90%)
- Some sounds still developing (normal)
- Increasing clarity over time
- Toddler frustrated if not understood (sign they know what they want to say)
- Can self-correct or repeat when asked

**Why it matters**

Speech intelligibility is an important language milestone. While perfect pronunciation isn't expected, adequate clarity allows communication beyond the family. If speech is largely unintelligible by 24 months and not improving, speech evaluation is recommended. Clarity supports social interaction, reduces frustration, and indicates healthy oral-motor and auditory development.

---

#### Says words like "I/me/we" (24 months)

**About**

Around 24 months, pronouns emerge. Toddlers begin using "I," "me," "my," and sometimes "we" and "you." Pronoun use is often inconsistent—mixing "me do it" with "Emma do it"—but the understanding is developing. Mastery of all pronouns takes several more years.

**What to look for**
- Using "I" and "me" in sentences ("I want cookie," "Me do it")
- May still mix with name use ("Emma turn")
- Beginning to use "my" and "mine"
- Possible confusion between I/me and you/me (very common)
- Pronouns used increasingly over time
- Understanding pronouns in context even if use is inconsistent

**Why it matters**

Pronouns show self-awareness, understanding of perspective (I vs. you), and advanced grammar. They make language more efficient and flexible. Pronoun development is complex and continues for years, but emergence at 24 months shows healthy language progression. Confusion is normal—English pronouns are tricky!

---

#### Says 2+ words with action word (24 months)

**About**

By 24 months, toddlers combine words into phrases that include action words (verbs): "Daddy go," "I want," "Doggy running," "Me eat." This shows understanding of actions as concepts and how to express them linguistically. It's the beginning of sentence structure.

**What to look for**
- Including verbs in two-word combinations
- Common verbs: go, want, eat, drink, play, run, see
- May omit verb endings ("Daddy go" vs. "Daddy goes")
- Using verbs to describe actions as they happen
- Requesting using verb phrases ("I go outside")
- Commenting on others' actions ("Mama cook")

**Why it matters**

Including verbs in sentences is crucial for expressing needs, describing events, and engaging in conversation. Verbs convey action and change—the dynamic elements of communication. Using verbs shows cognitive understanding of causation, time, and relationships. It dramatically expands what toddlers can communicate.

### SOCIAL & EMOTIONAL

#### Feeds self (20 months)

**About**

By 20 months, toddlers can feed themselves most meals using fingers and attempting utensils. They pick up finger foods efficiently with pincer grasp, drink from open cups with minimal spilling, and can get some food from spoon to mouth (though still messy). This is major independence and self-care.

**What to look for**
- Eating finger foods independently
- Using fork or spoon (even if awkward)
- Drinking from open cup without much spilling
- Can complete most of a meal independently
- Decreasing messiness over time (but still messy—normal)
- May refuse help ("Me do it!")

**Why it matters**

Self-feeding builds independence, fine motor skills, and self-esteem. It teaches cause-and-effect, problem-solving, and self-care. Allowing messiness and slow eating supports development—toddlers need practice to master these skills. Self-feeding also supports healthy eating habits and autonomy.

---

#### Takes off clothes (20 months)

**About**

Around 20 months, toddlers can remove simple clothing items: pulling off shoes, socks, hats, and loose pants. They're interested in undressing (often at inopportune times!) and may try dressing too. Putting clothes on is much harder and comes later.

**What to look for**
- Pulling off shoes, socks, hats independently
- Pulling down pants (especially elastic waist)
- May strip completely given the chance
- Interest in zippers, buttons, snaps (can't do them yet)
- Helping push arms through sleeves when dressing
- Pride in doing it themselves

**Why it matters**

Dressing skills build independence, fine motor skills, and self-care. They show problem-solving (figuring out how clothes work) and spatial awareness (body awareness). While undressing comes first, these skills lead to eventual dressing independence. Supporting attempts (even when slower) builds confidence and competence.

---

#### Matches objects to pictures (24 months)

**About**

By 24 months, toddlers can match real objects to pictures of those objects: holding a toy car next to a picture of a car, or bringing you a real apple when you point to apple in a book. This shows symbolic thinking—understanding that two-dimensional images represent three-dimensional objects.

**What to look for**
- Matching real objects to pictures
- Pointing at pictures that match objects they're holding
- Finding objects in books and environment
- Understanding that photos represent real things
- Matching becomes increasingly abstract (pictures that don't look identical)
- Using pictures to communicate ("Want this!" pointing at picture)

**Why it matters**

Matching pictures to objects shows symbolic thinking—foundational for reading, writing, math, and all academic learning. It shows toddlers understand representation: one thing can stand for another. This cognitive leap supports language (words represent things), pretend play (toys represent real objects), and later literacy (letters represent sounds).

---

#### Imitates others (24 months)

**About**

By 24 months, imitation is sophisticated and frequent. Toddlers copy actions, words, tones, and even emotions. They mimic cooking, cleaning, phone talking, or playing. They copy peers, siblings, TV characters, and adults. Imitation is a primary learning mechanism.

**What to look for**
- Copying actions after watching others
- Imitating speech patterns, phrases, or accents
- Playing "house" or mimicking adult activities
- Copying peers (if one runs, all run)
- Imitating delayed (reproducing actions seen earlier)
- May imitate negative behaviors too (testing)

**Why it matters**

Imitation is how toddlers learn. They observe, store, and reproduce—practicing new skills, language, and social behaviors. Imitation shows memory, attention, motor planning, and social awareness. It's how culture, language, and skills are transmitted. Being mindful of what toddlers observe is important—they're always watching and learning.

---

#### OK when separated (24 months)

**About**

By 24 months, many toddlers tolerate brief separations better than earlier. They may handle daycare drop-offs, babysitters, or parents leaving for errands with less distress. Separation anxiety eases (though may return during stress). This shows growing independence, object permanence, and trust.

**What to look for**
- Less crying or shorter crying at separations
- Can be distracted or soothed after parent leaves
- Engages in play after brief upset
- May wave goodbye without distress
- Understands parent will return
- Still prefers parents but can manage without them briefly

**Why it matters**

Easing separation anxiety shows secure attachment—toddlers trust that caregivers will return. It indicates developing independence and emotional regulation. While some anxiety is normal and healthy, excessive distress warrants support. Predictable routines, warm goodbyes (not sneaking away), and consistent returns build trust.

---

#### Tests limits (24 months)

**About**

Around 24 months, toddlers actively test boundaries: doing things they've been told not to, watching for reactions, and pushing back against rules. This isn't defiance—it's learning. They're figuring out what's consistent, what's negotiable, and how the world works.

**What to look for**
- Repeating behaviors after being told "no"
- Watching your reaction while doing something forbidden
- Saying "no" frequently
- Testing same limits repeatedly
- Checking if rules are consistent
- Different behavior with different caregivers (testing boundaries)

**Why it matters**

Testing limits is healthy development. Toddlers are learning about rules, consistency, and consequences. They're developing autonomy and understanding of social norms. Consistent, calm responses teach that rules are reliable and caregivers are trustworthy. This phase (though exhausting) is foundational for self-control, safety, and social behavior.

---

#### Has tantrums (24 months)

**About**

Tantrums peak around 24 months. Toddlers have big emotions, limited language, low impulse control, and strong desires—a perfect storm for meltdowns. Tantrums over seemingly small things (wrong color cup, broken cracker) are normal and developmental, not manipulation.

**What to look for**
- Intense crying, screaming, or physical outbursts
- Triggered by frustration, disappointment, or being told "no"
- Difficulty calming quickly
- May throw self down, hit, or kick
- Frequency varies (several per day to per week—both normal)
- Toddler needs help regulating—can't calm alone

**Why it matters**

Tantrums are normal and temporary. Toddlers aren't "being bad"—they're overwhelmed. Your calm, consistent response teaches emotional regulation over time. Tantrums decrease as language, self-control, and emotional skills develop (usually by 3–4 years). In the moment: ensure safety, offer comfort if accepted, wait it out. After: reconnect, talk about feelings, problem-solve for next time.

---

#### Less frightened (24 months)

**About**

Around 24 months, some early fears ease. Toddlers may be less afraid of vacuum cleaners, loud noises, or separation. This shows habituation (getting used to things), cognitive development (understanding what's safe), and increasing emotional regulation. New fears may also emerge—both are normal.

**What to look for**
- Less reaction to previously feared stimuli
- Increased confidence exploring
- Willing to approach things that used to scare them
- May still check back with caregiver for reassurance
- Some fears persist or new ones emerge (shadows, monsters, bugs)
- Using caregiver reactions to gauge safety

**Why it matters**

Decreasing fear shows learning, memory, and emotional regulation. Toddlers remember past experiences and realize "That was loud but I was safe." They also use social referencing—if you react calmly, they learn to stay calm. Supporting brave behavior while offering comfort builds confidence and resilience.

---

#### Cries if you're upset (24 months)

**About**

Around 24 months, toddlers show empathy—crying or becoming upset when they see others in distress. If you cry, they may cry, pat you, bring comfort objects, or become clingy. This is the beginning of empathy and understanding that others have feelings.

**What to look for**
- Reacting emotionally when others are upset
- Crying, looking worried, or becoming clingy
- Attempting to comfort (patting, hugging, offering toys)
- Checking faces to read emotions
- Awareness that something is wrong
- May become distressed in response to others' distress

**Why it matters**

Empathy is foundational for relationships, morality, and social connection. Recognizing and responding to others' emotions shows theory of mind (understanding that others have internal states) and compassion. This is how humans bond and cooperate. Modeling empathy and labeling emotions ("Mommy is sad") supports emotional development.

---

#### Jealous (24 months)

**About**

Around 24 months, jealousy emerges. Toddlers may react when a parent holds another child, when a sibling gets attention, or when toys are used by others. They may push others away, cry, or become clingy. This shows attachment, possessiveness, and awareness of relationships.

**What to look for**
- Protesting when parent attends to another child
- Pushing others away from caregivers or toys
- Saying "Mine!" or "My mama!"
- Increased clinginess when parent gives attention elsewhere
- May take toys from others
- Clear preference for exclusive attention

**Why it matters**

Jealousy shows attachment and awareness of relationships—toddlers know who matters to them and want to protect those connections. While challenging, it's developmentally appropriate. Teaching turn-taking, labeling feelings ("You want Mommy's attention"), and ensuring one-on-one time helps. Jealousy decreases as emotional regulation and understanding of relationships mature.

---

#### Recognizes self in mirror (24 months)

**About**

Around 18–24 months, toddlers recognize themselves in mirrors—the famous "rouge test" milestone. If you put a sticker on their forehead, they'll reach for their own forehead (not the mirror). This is self-awareness and understanding that the reflection is them.

**What to look for**
- Recognizing self in mirrors and photos
- Touching own face/body in response to mirror reflection
- Saying own name when seeing self
- Using mirror to check appearance or make faces
- Understanding difference between self and others in mirror
- Performing for mirror (dancing, making silly faces)

**Why it matters**

Self-recognition shows self-awareness—understanding "I am me, a separate person." This is foundational for identity, self-concept, and all social understanding. It's also linked to empathy, language development (using "I" and "me"), and emotional regulation. Self-awareness is uniquely human (and a few great apes) and is a major cognitive milestone.

---

#### Asks questions (24 months)

**About**

Around 24 months, questioning begins—often just "What's that?" repeated constantly. Toddlers are learning language, labeling the world, and figuring out how to get information. "Why?" questions explode later (around 3 years). Questioning shows curiosity and understanding that others have knowledge.

**What to look for**
- Asking "What's that?" or "What's this?" frequently
- Using rising intonation for questions
- Pointing while asking
- Waiting for answers
- May ask about the same thing repeatedly (learning)
- Beginning "Where?" questions

**Why it matters**

Asking questions is active learning. Toddlers are using language to gather information and make sense of the world. It shows cognitive curiosity, social understanding (knowing others can answer), and language sophistication. Answering patiently (even repetitively) supports vocabulary, knowledge, and the understanding that asking questions is powerful.

---

#### Interested in body/genitals (24 months)

**About**

Around 24 months, toddlers become curious about bodies—their own and others'. They may touch genitals, ask questions, notice differences between boys and girls, and show interest in bathroom activities. This is healthy curiosity and body exploration, not sexual.

**What to look for**
- Touching own genitals (especially during diaper changes or baths)
- Asking questions about body parts
- Noticing differences between boys and girls
- Interest in watching others use bathroom
- Exploring body during bath time
- Naming body parts including genitals

**Why it matters**

Body curiosity is normal and healthy. Toddlers are learning about their bodies, how they work, and similarities/differences. Responding matter-of-factly with correct anatomical terms supports healthy body awareness and safety. Shame or strong reactions can create unhealthy associations. Teaching privacy ("We touch our bodies in private places like bedroom or bathroom") and body autonomy ("Your body is yours") is important.

---

#### Says "no" often (24 months)

**About**

Around 24 months, "NO!" is a favorite word. Toddlers say no to everything—even things they want. This isn't defiance; it's practicing autonomy, language, and understanding cause-and-effect (what happens when I say no?). "No" gives toddlers a sense of control in a world where they have little.

**What to look for**
- Saying "no" frequently, sometimes to everything
- Saying no even to preferred activities
- Using "no" emphatically or repeatedly
- May say "no" then comply anyway
- Shaking head along with verbal "no"
- Testing the power of "no"

**Why it matters**

"No" is autonomy and boundary-setting practice. Toddlers are learning they're separate individuals with preferences and power. While exhausting, this is healthy development. It teaches decision-making, self-advocacy, and independence. Offering choices ("Apple or banana?"), picking battles, and respecting "no" when safe helps navigate this phase.

---

#### Enjoys praise (24 months)

**About**

By 24 months, praise is highly motivating. Toddlers work hard for approval, repeat behaviors that get positive attention, and beam with pride at accomplishments. They check for your reaction after achievements. Specific, genuine praise is powerful for shaping behavior and building self-esteem.

**What to look for**
- Repeating actions that get praise
- Checking for your reaction after accomplishments
- Smiling, clapping, or saying "Yay!" when praised
- Pride in achievements ("I did it!")
- Seeking attention for positive behaviors
- May ask for praise ("Good job, Mama?")

**Why it matters**

Praise shapes learning and behavior. Toddlers are motivated to master skills and behave positively when efforts are noticed. Specific praise ("You stacked those blocks so high!") is more effective than generic praise ("Good job!"). Praise builds self-esteem, intrinsic motivation, and persistence. It also strengthens the parent-child relationship.

---

#### Interested in same-age children (24 months)

**About**

By 24 months, toddlers show clear interest in peers. They watch other children, imitate them, play alongside them (parallel play), and occasionally interact directly. They're beginning to prefer child companionship over adult for some activities. True cooperative play develops later (around 3–4 years).

**What to look for**
- Watching other children intently
- Imitating peers
- Playing near other children (parallel play)
- Occasional direct interaction (may be positive or conflictual)
- Showing excitement around other children
- Preferring play areas where other children are

**Why it matters**

Interest in peers is foundational for social development. Toddlers learn from each other, practice social skills, and begin forming friendships. Peer interaction is different from adult interaction—messier, more reciprocal, with more conflict but also more discovery. Facilitating peer play supports social, emotional, and cognitive development.

---

#### Notices when others hurt/upset (24 months)

**About**

By 24 months, toddlers notice when others are hurt or upset and often respond with concern. They may approach, offer comfort, look worried, or seek adult help. This is emerging empathy and shows awareness that others have feelings and needs.

**What to look for**
- Reacting when other children or adults cry or show distress
- Approaching upset person with concern
- Offering comfort (patting, hugging, bringing toy)
- Facial expressions showing worry or concern
- May cry in response to others' distress
- Seeking adult help ("Mama, baby sad!")

**Why it matters**

Noticing others' emotions is the foundation of empathy, compassion, and prosocial behavior. It shows theory of mind (understanding others have internal states) and caring. These early empathic responses predict kindness, cooperation, and healthy relationships. Modeling empathy and helping toddlers understand others' feelings supports moral development.

---

### COGNITIVE

#### Scribbles with crayon (20 months)

**About**

By 20 months, scribbling becomes more intentional and sustained. Toddlers may hold crayons with whole-hand or emerging tripod grasp and make a variety of marks—lines, curves, circles, dots. They understand that tools create marks and enjoy the cause-and-effect. This is pre-writing and pre-drawing.

**What to look for**
- Making various marks on paper
- Sustained scribbling (several minutes)
- May hold crayon in fist or with fingers
- Intentional marks rather than random waving
- Pleasure in making marks
- May scribble on many surfaces (supervision needed!)

**Why it matters**

Scribbling develops hand strength, fine motor control, and hand-eye coordination—all necessary for writing. It's also symbolic thinking: marks represent something (even if just "I made this"). Scribbling supports creativity, expression, and visual-motor integration. Providing varied tools (crayons, markers, chalk) and surfaces supports development.

---

#### Pretend play (24 months)

**About**

By 24 months, pretend play is frequent and increasingly complex. Toddlers create scenarios with storylines, use objects symbolically (block as phone, banana as phone), and assign roles ("You be the baby"). They imitate real life and create imaginary scenarios. This is sophisticated symbolic thinking.

**What to look for**
- Engaging in pretend scenarios regularly
- Multi-step pretend sequences (feeding doll then putting to bed)
- Using objects symbolically
- Assigning roles or involving others
- Narrating play ("I'm cooking dinner")
- Can sustain pretend play for 10+ minutes
- Blending reality and fantasy

**Why it matters**

Pretend play is one of the most important types of play for development. It supports:
- Cognitive development (symbolic thinking, problem-solving, planning)
- Language (practicing conversations, storytelling, new vocabulary)
- Social skills (cooperation, perspective-taking, turn-taking)
- Emotional regulation (working through feelings, practicing scenarios)
- Creativity and imagination

Rich pretend play predicts school readiness, creativity, and social competence.

---

#### Copies lines (24 months)

**About**

By 24 months, toddlers can copy both vertical and horizontal lines after demonstration. They may also spontaneously draw circular scribbles. This shows increasing fine motor control, visual-motor integration, and understanding of intentional mark-making. Circles and crosses come next (around 3 years).

**What to look for**
- Copying vertical lines
- Copying horizontal lines (often harder than vertical)
- Lines may be approximate (not perfectly straight)
- Shows intention to copy
- May spontaneously draw circular scribbles
- Increasing control and accuracy over time

**Why it matters**

Copying lines is a pre-writing skill. It shows visual processing (seeing the line), motor planning (planning the movement), and motor execution (making the mark). The developmental sequence—vertical line, horizontal line, circle, cross—leads to letter and number formation. Supporting early drawing builds skills for writing and school readiness.

---

#### Enjoys repetition (24 months)

**About**

Around 24 months, toddlers love repetition—same books over and over, same songs, same routines. They memorize stories, anticipate next words, and protest variations. This isn't boring to them—it's learning. Repetition wires the brain and provides security.

**What to look for**
- Requesting same books/songs repeatedly
- Memorizing favorite books and "reading" along
- Correcting if you skip pages or change words
- Comfort in familiar routines
- May watch same video clips over and over
- Repeating games or activities

**Why it matters**

Repetition is how toddlers learn. Each repetition strengthens neural pathways, builds memory, and deepens understanding. Predictability provides security and allows toddlers to focus on new details each time. While adults find repetition tedious, it's optimal learning for toddlers. Honoring requests for repetition (while gradually introducing novelty) supports development.

---

#### Matches objects to pictures (24 months)

**About**

By 24 months, toddlers can match real objects to pictures reliably, and increasingly can match pictures to pictures. They understand that two-dimensional representations correspond to three-dimensional objects. This is foundational for reading, maps, and all symbolic learning.

**What to look for**
- Matching objects to pictures in books
- Pointing to pictures that match objects they're holding
- Finding objects in environment that match pictures
- Playing matching games or puzzles
- Understanding that photos represent real things
- Increasingly abstract matching (pictures that don't look identical)

**Why it matters**

Matching shows symbolic thinking—understanding representation. It's foundational for:
- Reading (letters represent sounds, words represent things)
- Math (numbers represent quantities)
- Maps (pictures represent places)
- Pretend play (toys represent real objects)

This cognitive skill supports all academic learning and abstract thinking.

---

#### Enjoys puzzles/textured books (24 months)

**About**

By 24 months, toddlers enjoy simple puzzles (2–6 pieces) and interactive books with textures, flaps, or sounds. They can rotate pieces, try different orientations, and problem-solve. They explore books tactilely and visually. This supports spatial reasoning, problem-solving, and pre-literacy.

**What to look for**
- Completing simple puzzles (2–6 pieces)
- Rotating pieces to fit
- Persistence if piece doesn't fit initially
- Touching textures in books
- Lifting flaps
- Requesting favorite books and puzzles
- Sustained engagement with books

**Why it matters**

Puzzles teach spatial reasoning, problem-solving, and fine motor skills. They show visual processing, attention, and persistence. Book engagement builds pre-literacy: understanding that books tell stories, turning pages, and associating words with pictures. Both activities support cognitive development, attention, and school readiness.

---

#### Holds container while taking off lid (24 months)

**About**

Around 24 months, toddlers demonstrate bilateral coordination by holding a container steady with one hand while removing the lid with the other. This is problem-solving and shows understanding that two hands can work together on different sub-tasks.

**What to look for**
- Stabilizing container with one hand
- Removing lid with other hand
- Can do this with various containers (cups, boxes, bottles)
- May need help with tight lids
- Increasing speed and efficiency over time
- Can reverse: putting lids back on

**Why it matters**

This shows bilateral coordination—two hands working together on different tasks. It's problem-solving (figuring out the container needs to be held), motor planning, and functional skill. Bilateral coordination is essential for all daily activities: buttoning, tying, opening packages, using utensils. It shows brain integration and sophisticated motor control.

---

#### Uses switches/knobs (24 months)

**About**

By 24 months, toddlers figure out how to operate switches, knobs, buttons, and levers. They turn on lights, adjust volume, open doors, turn faucets. This is problem-solving, understanding cause-and-effect, and functional tool use.

**What to look for**
- Operating light switches
- Turning doorknobs (may not have strength for all)
- Pushing buttons (elevator, toys, remotes)
- Turning knobs or dials
- Understanding what controls do
- Persistence in figuring out how things work

**Why it matters**

Operating controls shows cause-and-effect understanding, problem-solving, and functional tool use. It builds independence (turning on lights, opening doors) and cognitive understanding of how things work. It also shows observational learning—toddlers watch and reproduce what they've seen. Safety note: Child-proofing remains important as toddlers become more capable.

---

#### Plays with multiple toys at once (24 months)

**About**

Around 24 months, play becomes more complex. Toddlers can play with multiple toys simultaneously, creating scenes or stories: cars on a road mat, dolls in a dollhouse, blocks with animals. This shows planning, imagination, and the ability to coordinate multiple elements.

**What to look for**
- Using multiple toys together in play
- Creating scenes or scenarios
- Combining toys in novel ways
- Sustained complex play
- May narrate play involving multiple elements
- Shows planning and organization in play

**Why it matters**

Multi-toy play shows cognitive complexity: holding multiple elements in mind, planning, and creating relationships between objects. It supports executive function (planning, organization), creativity, problem-solving, and storytelling. This type of play predicts school readiness and abstract thinking abilities.

---

### GROWTH

#### Continued steady growth with changing proportions

**About**

Growth during months 18–24 continues at the slowed toddler pace. By 20 months, boys average around 25 lbs and girls 23 lb 7 oz. By 24 months (2nd birthday), boys typically weigh around 27 lb 8 oz and girls 26 lb 7 oz. Height gain averages 4–5 inches per year during toddlerhood. Head circumference growth has slowed significantly as brain growth stabilizes. Body proportions continue changing—longer legs, more upright posture, decreasing pot belly. Appetite continues to be erratic as growth remains slower than infancy.

**What to look for**
- By 20 months: Boys ~25 lbs, Girls ~23.5 lbs
- By 24 months: Boys ~27.5 lbs, Girls ~26.5 lbs
- Height gain of 4–5 inches per year
- Head circumference growth slowing
- More proportionate body—longer legs, slimmer trunk
- Continued appetite fluctuations (normal)
- Individual growth patterns following consistent percentiles

**Why it matters**

Steady, consistent growth along a child's established percentile curve indicates healthy development. The slowed growth rate is appropriate for this age—energy goes toward constant activity, learning, and development. Changing body proportions support new motor skills. Healthcare providers monitor for concerning patterns: crossing percentiles dramatically, falling off growth curves, or poor weight-to-height ratios. Most variation is normal; consistent patterns matter most. Erratic eating is developmentally normal and shouldn't be forced—trust appetite cues and offer nutritious options.

---

### TEETH

#### Second molars beginning; primary teeth completing

**About**

During months 18–24 and beyond, the final primary teeth emerge. Second molars typically begin appearing around 23–33 months—these are the large back teeth used for grinding food. Canines continue erupting through this period. By 24 months, most children have 16–20 teeth, and by age 2.5–3 years, all 20 primary teeth are usually present (10 upper, 10 lower). Second molar eruption can be particularly uncomfortable due to tooth size and location.

**What to look for**
- Second molars beginning (23–33 months), often most uncomfortable
- Most have 16–20 teeth by 24 months
- Complete set of 20 primary teeth by 2.5–3 years
- Significant teething discomfort possible with second molars
- Full chewing ability once molars are present
- Brushing twice daily with fluoride toothpaste (rice-grain size)
- Regular dental checkups recommended

**Why it matters**

Complete primary dentition allows full chewing capability, supporting nutrition and oral-motor development. Proper dental care prevents cavities, which can affect permanent teeth development and overall health. Primary teeth hold space for permanent teeth and support proper jaw development. Understanding that second molars are often the most uncomfortable helps parents provide appropriate comfort and medical care if needed. Establishing good dental habits now prevents problems later.

---

### VISION

#### Eye-hand coordination and depth perception well developed

**About**

Vision at 18–24 months is essentially mature in terms of acuity and coordination. Eye-hand coordination and depth perception are well developed, allowing toddlers to manipulate small objects, complete puzzles, draw, and navigate complex environments safely. Vision can now focus on near and far objects quickly. Color recognition improves, and toddlers may begin correctly identifying colors. Visual memory is strong—children remember people, places, and objects from weeks or months prior.

**What to look for**
- Excellent eye-hand coordination for fine motor tasks
- Well-developed depth perception (navigating stairs, jumping, climbing)
- Quick focus changes from near to far
- Color interest and beginning naming
- Strong visual memory for familiar people and places
- Completing visual tasks (puzzles, matching games)
- Vision essentially mature (20/20 or close)

**Why it matters**

Mature vision supports all learning, play, safety, and independence. Eye-hand coordination enables fine motor skills critical for self-care and later writing. Depth perception keeps toddlers safe during active play. Visual memory supports learning, routines, and relationships. Most vision development is complete, though fine-tuning continues. Any persistent vision concerns (crossing, squinting, bumping into things, lack of eye contact) warrant professional evaluation. Early detection and treatment of vision problems yields best outcomes.

---

### HEARING

#### Rapid language development and following multi-step instructions

**About**

Auditory and language development during months 18–24 can be explosive. Many toddlers experience a "vocabulary explosion" during this period, going from 50 words to 200+ words. Two-word combinations emerge ("More milk," "Daddy go," "Big truck"), showing grammar development. Toddlers can follow 2-step commands, understand simple concepts (big/small, in/out), and enjoy longer stories and songs. Comprehension far exceeds expression—toddlers understand complex sentences even when speaking in 2–3 word phrases.

**What to look for**
- Vocabulary explosion (50+ words by 24 months, some much more)
- Two-word combinations emerging ("More juice," "Daddy work")
- Following 2-step instructions
- Understanding concepts: big/small, in/out, hot/cold
- Half of speech understandable to strangers
- Using action words, descriptors, names
- Asking "What's that?" questions
- Enjoying stories, songs, rhymes

**Why it matters**

This period is critical for language development. The vocabulary explosion sets up grammar, conversation, and literacy. Two-word combinations show emerging grammar—understanding that word order matters ("push car" vs "car push"). Following multi-step instructions shows working memory and comprehension. If a child isn't using 25+ words or any two-word combinations by 24 months, evaluation is recommended. Early language skills strongly predict literacy, academic success, and social competence. Rich language exposure (talking, reading, singing) accelerates development.

---

## 24-36 MONTHS (2-3 YEARS)

### GROSS MOTOR SKILLS

#### Twists things (doorknobs, lids) (30 months)

**About**

Around 30 months, the fine motor skill of twisting emerges. Children can turn doorknobs, twist off jar lids, turn faucet handles, and manipulate rotary toys. This requires wrist rotation, grip strength, and bilateral coordination. Early attempts may lack the strength for tight lids or stiff knobs, but the movement pattern is there.

**What to look for**
- Attempting to turn doorknobs (may need help with leverage)
- Twisting off loose lids from containers
- Turning toy knobs and dials
- Using both hands to twist (one to stabilize, one to turn)
- Increasing strength and coordination over time
- Understanding the twisting motion produces results

**Why it matters**

Twisting is a functional skill needed for independence: opening doors, containers, and faucets. It shows sophisticated fine motor control—wrist rotation combined with grip strength. It also demonstrates problem-solving (figuring out which direction to twist) and persistence. This skill supports self-care and independence.

---

#### Takes off some clothes (30 months)

**About**

By 30 months, undressing skills advance. Children can remove loose clothing independently: pulling off shirts, stepping out of pants, taking off socks and shoes. They understand the sequence of undressing and may start helping with dressing too. Putting clothes on remains harder and develops more slowly.

**What to look for**
- Removing shirts by pulling over head
- Stepping out of pants and underwear
- Taking off socks and shoes independently
- Understanding which items come off in which order
- Pride in doing it themselves
- Beginning to help with dressing (pushing arms through sleeves)

**Why it matters**

Dressing skills build independence, fine and gross motor skills, and self-care. They show problem-solving (figuring out how clothes work), body awareness (knowing which body part goes where), and sequencing (order of removing clothing). These skills are essential for toileting independence and self-sufficiency.

---

#### Jumps off ground with both feet (30 months)

**About**

By 30 months, jumping matures significantly. Children can jump off the ground with both feet leaving simultaneously and landing together. They can jump forward, jump in place repeatedly, and may attempt jumping over small objects. This shows leg strength, coordination, balance, and spatial awareness.

**What to look for**
- Both feet leaving ground at the same time
- Landing with both feet together
- Jumping forward several inches
- Jumping repeatedly (hopping up and down)
- May attempt jumping off low steps
- Arms swinging for momentum and balance

**Why it matters**

---

#### Names 2+ colors (30 months)

**About**

Around 30 months, children begin identifying colors correctly—typically starting with 2–3 colors (often red, blue, yellow). They can point to colors when named and may start naming colors spontaneously. Full color knowledge (8–10 colors) usually comes by age 4–5.

**What to look for**
- Identifying 2–3 colors correctly
- Can point to named colors
- May name colors spontaneously
- Increasing color vocabulary
- May confuse some colors still (normal)
- Interest in colors and color games

**Why it matters**

Color knowledge is pre-academic learning showing memory, vocabulary, and categorization. It's useful for description, following instructions, and early math (sorting, patterns). While not critical for development, color knowledge is a school readiness skill and cognitive milestone.

---

#### Draws circle when shown (36 months)

**About**

Around 3 years, children can copy a circle after demonstration. This is a major pre-writing milestone—circles are harder than lines because they require continuous curved motion without reversing direction. Early circles may be wobbly or incomplete; perfection isn't expected.

**What to look for**
- Drawing approximate circle after demonstration
- Continuous curved line (even if not closed)
- May be wobbly or egg-shaped
- Shows intention to copy circle
- May spontaneously draw circles
- Increasing accuracy over time

**Why it matters**

Copying circles is pre-writing and shows fine motor control, visual-motor integration, and motor planning. The developmental sequence—vertical line, horizontal line, circle, cross, square—leads to letter formation. Circles are components of many letters and numbers. Supporting drawing builds writing readiness.

---

#### Avoids hot objects when warned (36 months)

**What to look for**
- Stopping when warned about hot objects
- Showing caution around stoves, ovens, hot drinks
- Can say "Hot" and explain danger
- Remembering warnings over time
- May point out hot things to others
- Impulse control improving

**Why it matters**

Safety awareness and impulse control are critical for injury prevention. Understanding warnings shows language comprehension, memory, and developing executive function (impulse control). While supervision is still essential, children's emerging safety awareness allows increasing independence and freedom.

---

### GROWTH

#### Body proportions becoming more child-like

**About**

Growth during years 2–3 continues at the steady preschool pace. By 30 months, boys average around 29 lb 5 oz and girls 28 lb 2 oz. By 36 months (3rd birthday), boys typically weigh around 31 lb 12 oz and girls 30 lb 10 oz. Body proportions are shifting toward childhood appearance—longer legs, slimmer trunk, less toddler "belly." Height increases steadily. Appetite remains variable, which is normal and healthy. BMI (body mass index) becomes a useful measurement tool alongside height and weight.

**What to look for**
- By 30 months: Boys ~29 lbs, Girls ~28 lbs
- By 36 months: Boys ~32 lbs, Girls ~31 lbs
- Body proportions more child-like—longer, leaner
- Height increasing steadily (averaging 2–3 inches per year)
- Appetite continues to fluctuate
- Energy levels high with constant activity
- Individual growth patterns following established curves

**Why it matters**

Steady growth along established percentile curves indicates health. Growth velocity matters more than absolute size—consistent growth is key. Body proportion changes support increasingly sophisticated motor skills—running, jumping, climbing, balancing. Variable appetites are normal; children are good at self-regulating intake over several days. Forcing food can create unhealthy relationships with eating. BMI helps assess whether height and weight are proportionate. Healthcare providers monitor growth to ensure healthy development.

---

### TEETH

#### Complete primary dentition established

**About**

By age 2.5–3 years, all 20 primary teeth are typically present: 10 upper (4 incisors, 2 canines, 4 molars) and 10 lower (same distribution). Second molars complete the set, usually erupting by 23–33 months. These teeth will remain (with normal wear) until age 6–12, when they begin falling out and are replaced by permanent teeth. Proper care prevents decay and ensures healthy development of permanent teeth beneath.

**What to look for**
- Complete set of 20 primary teeth by age 3 (10 upper, 10 lower)
- Second molars completing (23–33 months)
- All teeth types present: incisors, canines, molars
- Regular brushing twice daily essential
- Regular dental checkups (every 6 months recommended)
- May begin to see spacing between teeth (normal—jaw growing)
- No decay or significant dental issues

**Why it matters**

Complete primary dentition allows full chewing function and supports nutrition. Primary teeth are critical: they hold space for permanent teeth, guide permanent teeth eruption, support jaw development and facial structure, and enable clear speech development. Decay in primary teeth can damage developing permanent teeth and cause pain, infection, and eating difficulties. Good dental care now establishes lifelong habits. Spacing between teeth is normal as jaws grow—it provides room for larger permanent teeth.

---

### VISION

#### Vision fully developed to adult level

**About**

By age 3, vision has reached adult functional levels. Visual acuity is typically 20/20 or close. Children can identify and match colors reliably. Visual memory is well-established—children remember people, places, and events from months before. Eye-hand coordination supports detailed tasks like drawing, cutting, and manipulating small objects. Depth perception and spatial awareness are mature.

**What to look for**
- Visual acuity approaching 20/20
- Identifying and matching colors correctly
- Strong visual memory for people, places, events
- Excellent eye-hand coordination for fine motor tasks
- Depth perception supporting safe navigation
- Sustained visual attention (10+ minutes)
- Recognizing letters and shapes
- No persistent eye issues (crossing, turning, squinting)

**Why it matters**

Mature vision supports all learning, play, and daily functioning. Visual skills are foundational for school readiness—recognizing letters, numbers, colors, and shapes. Eye-hand coordination enables writing and detailed manipulative tasks. Visual memory supports learning and following routines. Most children should have comprehensive eye exams before starting school (age 3–5) to identify and correct any issues. Early detection of vision problems allows intervention before they impact learning.

---

### HEARING

#### Clear speech and following complex instructions

**About**

By age 3, auditory and language development is sophisticated. Speech is clear enough that strangers understand most of what children say (75–90%). Vocabulary is large—300–1000+ words. Children use 3–4+ word sentences with increasingly correct grammar. They follow 2–3 part instructions when focused: "Put on your shoes, get your coat, and wait by the door." They understand most of what's said in everyday conversation, including abstract concepts.

**What to look for**
- Clear speech strangers understand most of the time
- Vocabulary of 300–1000+ words
- Using 3–4+ word sentences
- Following 2–3 part instructions when focused
- Understanding most conversation
- Asking and answering questions
- Using sounds b, p, n, m, d, t, w, h clearly
- Some later sounds (r, th, l, s blends) still developing

**Why it matters**

Language at this level supports school readiness, social interaction, and learning. Clear speech allows effective communication with teachers and peers. Large vocabulary and good comprehension enable learning from instruction. Following multi-step directions is essential for classroom success. If speech is significantly unclear, vocabulary is limited (<200 words), or child doesn't follow simple instructions by age 3, evaluation is strongly recommended. Early intervention for speech and language issues is highly effective.

### GROWTH

#### Kindergarten-ready physique; individual variation wide

**About**

Growth during ages 4–5 years continues at the slow, steady preschool/early childhood pace. By 60 months (5th birthday), boys average around 40 lbs and girls 39 lbs. Height is approximately 43–44 inches. Adult proportions are well-established—long legs, defined muscles, upright posture. Growth rate remains consistent: about 4–5 pounds and 2–3 inches per year. BMI is an important measurement for assessing healthy weight-to-height ratios. Wide individual variation is normal—some 5-year-olds are much larger or smaller than average, and both can be healthy.

**What to look for**
- By 60 months: Boys ~40 lbs, Girls ~39 lbs
- Height approximately 43–44 inches
- Adult-like body proportions well-established
- Growth rate steady: 4–5 lbs/year, 2–3 inches/year
- BMI indicates healthy weight-to-height ratio

- Physical capabilities supporting active play

**Why it matters**

Steady growth along established percentile curves through early childhood predicts healthy patterns ahead. Physical development supports school readiness—strength and coordination for PE, recess, and active learning. BMI helps identify children outside healthy ranges who may benefit from nutrition or activity support. Healthcare providers look at overall patterns, not single measurements. Most 5-year-olds are ready for the physical demands of kindergarten. Continued active play, good nutrition, and adequate sleep support healthy growth.

---

### TEETH

#### Primary teeth stable; permanent teeth preparing to emerge

**About**

By age 5, all 20 primary teeth should be present, stable, and healthy. Spacing between teeth is normal and desirable—jaws are growing to accommodate future permanent teeth. Around age 6 (sometimes 5, sometimes 7—normal variation), the first permanent molars erupt behind the primary teeth, and the first primary teeth (usually lower central incisors) begin loosening and falling out. Primary teeth will continue falling out through ages 6–12 as permanent teeth emerge. Excellent dental care during age 5 sets up healthy permanent teeth.

**What to look for**
- All 20 primary teeth present and healthy
- Spacing between teeth (normal jaw growth)
- Regular brushing twice daily with pea-sized fluoride toothpaste
- Regular dental checkups every 6 months
- No decay, pain, or dental problems
- Looking ahead: first permanent molars around age 6
- Looking ahead: first loose teeth around age 6
- Understanding dental health importance

**Why it matters**

Primary teeth remain critical until permanent teeth are ready. They hold space, guide permanent tooth eruption, support proper jaw development and facial structure, enable nutrition through proper chewing, and support clear speech. Decay or premature loss of primary teeth can cause permanent teeth problems. Children who lose primary teeth too early (from decay or injury) may need space maintainers. Excellent dental care now prevents future problems. Understanding that teeth will soon start falling out (normal and exciting!) prepares children for this milestone.

---

### VISION

#### Vision fully mature; school readiness established

**About**

By age 5, vision is typically fully mature with 20/20 acuity (or very close). All visual skills are adult-level: tracking, focusing near and far, depth perception, color recognition, visual memory, and eye-hand coordination. Visual perception skills support reading: recognizing letters, tracking text left-to-right, distinguishing similar letters (b/d, p/q), and visual memory for sight words.

Mature vision is critical for school success. Reading, writing, math, and classroom learning all depend on excellent vision. Even minor vision problems can significantly impact learning and behavior. ALL children should have comprehensive eye exams before kindergarten (age 3–5). Problems detected early (nearsightedness, farsightedness, astigmatism, lazy eye, eye muscle issues) can be corrected with glasses, patching, or vision therapy. Starting school with optimal vision ensures children can learn effectively from day one.

---

### HEARING

#### Hearing fully mature; advanced language supporting school readiness

**Why it matters**

Excellent hearing and language are foundational for school success. Classroom learning depends on hearing teachers, following instructions, participating in discussions, and interacting with peers. ALL children should have hearing screenings before kindergarten. Even mild hearing loss significantly impacts learning, speech clarity, and social development. Early detection allows intervention (hearing aids, speech therapy, classroom accommodations, preferential seating) that ensures children can access learning fully. Language skills at kindergarten entry strongly predict reading achievement and academic success throughout school.

---

## SCREENING & INTERVENTION GUIDELINES

### General Developmental Screening

**About**

Developmental screening uses standardized tools to identify children who may need further evaluation or early intervention. The American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP) recommends routine developmental screening at 9, 18, and 30 months, with additional screening anytime parents or providers have concerns. Common screening tools include the Ages and Stages Questionnaire (ASQ), Parents' Evaluation of Developmental Status (PEDS), and Survey of Wellbeing of Young Children (SWYC).

**What to look for**
- Screenings at 9, 18, and 30 months minimum
- Standardized, validated screening tools (not informal checklists)
- Screening all developmental domains: motor, language, cognitive, social-emotional
- Parent concerns taken seriously and prompting screening
- Referral for evaluation if screening indicates concerns
- Early intervention referral for children birth-3 with delays

**Why it matters**

Early detection of developmental delays allows early intervention, which is most effective during the critical early years when the brain is most plastic. Children who receive early intervention services show better outcomes in language, cognition, motor skills, and social-emotional development. Screening catches concerns early, before they widen into significant delays. Federal law (IDEA Part C) guarantees early intervention services for eligible children birth to age 3, at no cost to families.

---

### Autism Screening

**About**

Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) screening is recommended at 18 and 24 months, or any time concerns arise. The Modified Checklist for Autism in Toddlers, Revised (M-CHAT-R) is a commonly used tool. Red flags include lack of response to name, limited eye contact, lack of joint attention (pointing to show interest), delayed or absent speech, repetitive behaviors, and loss of previously acquired skills.

**What to look for**
- Formal autism screening at 18 and 24 months
- Any concerns prompting immediate screening (don't wait)
- Red flags: no response to name, limited eye contact, no pointing/gestures, speech delays, repetitive behaviors
- Regression (losing previously mastered skills) especially concerning
- Immediate referral for comprehensive evaluation if screening positive
- Early intervention critical for best outcomes

**Why it matters**

Early autism diagnosis (possible by age 2) and early intensive intervention significantly improve outcomes. Children who receive early intervention show better language development, social skills, cognitive abilities, and adaptive functioning. The earlier intervention starts, the better. Don't "wait and see" if concerns arise—immediate evaluation is recommended. ASD is diagnosed through comprehensive evaluation by specialists (developmental pediatricians, psychologists, neurologists).

---

### Vision Screening

**About**

Vision screening should occur before starting school (ages 3–5), with first comprehensive eye exams recommended at 6–12 months, especially for children with family history of eye problems. Screenings check visual acuity, eye alignment, eye movement, and overall eye health. Common issues include amblyopia (lazy eye), strabismus (eye misalignment), refractive errors (nearsighted, farsighted, astigmatism), and color vision deficiency.

**What to look for**
- First comprehensive eye exam at 6–12 months (AAP recommendation)
- Vision screening before kindergarten (essential)
- Professional eye exams if family history of eye problems
- Red flags: crossed eyes, eye turning, squinting, sitting very close to TV, difficulty with visual tasks
- Early treatment for amblyopia most effective before age 7
- Glasses, patching, or vision therapy as needed

**Why it matters**

Vision problems are common but often missed without formal screening. About 1 in 20 preschoolers have vision problems that could affect learning. Many vision issues (especially lazy eye) must be treated early for best results—after age 7-9, treatment is less effective. Undetected vision problems cause unnecessary struggles in school and can be mistaken for learning disabilities or behavior problems. Early detection and treatment ensure children start school able to see clearly and learn effectively.

---

### Hearing Screening

**About**

All babies should have newborn hearing screens before hospital discharge. Additional hearing screening is recommended before starting school. About 1-3 in 1,000 babies are born with hearing loss, and others develop hearing loss later from ear infections, illnesses, or noise exposure. Even mild hearing loss impacts speech and language development significantly.

**What to look for**
- Newborn hearing screen for all babies (mandated in most states)
- Re-screening if newborn screen not passed or concerns arise
- Hearing screening before kindergarten
- Red flags: not responding to sounds, unclear speech, asking "what?" frequently, difficulty following instructions
- Immediate evaluation if concerns
- Hearing aids, cochlear implants, or other interventions as needed

**Why it matters**

Early hearing loss detection allows immediate intervention, preventing speech and language delays. Babies identified with hearing loss and given hearing aids or cochlear implants by 6 months develop language on schedule. Delays in detection cause cascading delays in speech, language, reading, and social development. Even temporary hearing loss from chronic ear infections can impact development. Early detection, treatment, and intervention (hearing devices, speech therapy, educational support) ensure children develop to their full potential.

| Type | Timing | Notes |
|------|--------|-------|
| **General Developmental Screening** | 9, 18, and 30 months | Use standardized, validated tools (e.g., ASQ, M-CHAT) |
| **Autism Screening** | 18 and 24 months | Or whenever parent/provider has concern; earlier is better |
| **Vision Screening** | Before starting school (age 3–5) | First comprehensive eye exam recommended at 6–12 months |
| **Hearing Screening** | At birth, before starting school | All babies should have newborn hearing screen; rescreen if concerns |
| **Speech/Language Evaluation** | If speech unclear by age 3, or limited vocabulary by age 2 | Earlier intervention = better outcomes |
| **Behavioral/Emotional Screening** | Ongoing, especially during transitions | Persistent tantrums, extreme fears, aggression warrant evaluation |

## WHEN TO SEEK HELP

**Contact your healthcare provider if:**

- **Motor Development:**
  - Child not walking independently by 18 months
  - Persistent tightness, weakness, or asymmetry in movements
  - Loss of previously acquired motor skills
  - Extreme clumsiness or difficulty with age-appropriate motor tasks

- **Communication & Language:**
  - No words by 15 months
  - Not combining words by 24 months
  - Speech largely unintelligible by 3 years
  - Not using 4+ word sentences by 4 years
  - Loss of language skills at any age
  - Stuttering that persists beyond age 4–5 or causes distress

- **Social & Emotional:**
  - Doesn't respond to name by 12 months
  - Doesn't engage in eye contact or social smiling
  - No interest in other children by age 3
  - Extreme separation anxiety beyond age 3
  - Persistent aggression, self-injury, or explosive behaviors
  - Extreme fears that interfere with daily life

- **Cognitive & Play:**
  - Doesn't engage in pretend play by age 2–3
  - No interest in books or learning by age 4
  - Extreme difficulty with attention or focus
  - Cannot follow simple instructions by age 3

- **Sensory:**
  - Extreme reactions to textures, sounds, lights, or touch
  - Doesn't respond to sounds or pain
  - Seeking or avoiding sensory input in extreme ways

- **General Red Flags:**
  - Loss of ANY previously acquired skills (regression)
  - Persistent parent concerns even if child "passes" screenings
  - Family history of developmental disorders

**Remember:** Early intervention makes the biggest difference. When in doubt, get evaluated—it's better to be reassured than to wait and worry.

## IMPORTANT NOTES

| Topic | Information |
|-------|-------------|
| **Premature Babies** | Use corrected age (age since due date, not birth) for milestone expectations until age 2–3 if born >3 weeks early |
| **Individual Variation** | These age ranges show when 75% of children achieve milestones. All children develop at their own pace. Some variation is normal and expected. |
| **Milestone Ranges** | Most milestones have 3–6 month typical ranges. Being slightly "early" or "late" is usually normal variation, not cause for concern. |
| **Multiple Domains** | Development happens across domains simultaneously. A child may be advanced in motor skills and average in language, or vice versa—this is normal. |
| **Screen Time Guidelines (AAP)** | • Under 18 months: None except video calls<br>• 18–24 months: High-quality programming, co-viewed with parent<br>• 2–5 years: Max 1 hour/day of high-quality programming<br>• Avoid screens during meals and 1 hour before bed |
| **Sleep Needs (by age)** | • 0–3 months: 14–17 hours<br>• 4–11 months: 12–16 hours<br>• 1–2 years: 11–14 hours (including naps)<br>• 3–5 years: 10–13 hours (including naps)<br>• Quality sleep supports all development |
| **Play is Learning** | Play is how children learn. "Playing" IS the work of childhood. Rich, varied play supports all developmental domains. |
| **Early Intervention** | Services available birth to age 3 for children with developmental delays or disabilities. Contact your local early intervention program for free evaluation. Earlier intervention = better outcomes. |
| **Books & Reading** | Daily shared book reading is the single strongest predictor of literacy and school success. Read to your child every day from birth. |
| **Language Development** | Talking, singing, and reading to children is critical for language development. The more words children hear, the larger their vocabulary and the stronger their language skills. |
| **Bilingualism** | Learning two languages simultaneously is beneficial for development. Bilingual children may have slightly later vocabulary in each language but normal total vocabulary. Bilingualism supports cognitive flexibility. |
| **Play Types** | Children need varied play: active/physical play, pretend/dramatic play, constructive play (building), games with rules, art/creative play, and outdoor play. Each supports different developmental areas. |

## SUPPORTING DEVELOPMENT: PARENT TIPS

**General Principles:**
- **Follow the child's lead** in play and learning
- **Narrate daily life** to build language
- **Read together daily** from infancy
- **Provide varied experiences**: nature, music, art, movement, social interaction
- **Allow messiness** in learning (food, art, water play)
- **Support independence** even when it's slower
- **Respond warmly** to communication attempts
- **Play actively** with your child
- **Limit screen time** and prioritize active, creative play
- **Celebrate effort** more than perfection
- **Trust your instincts**—you know your child best

**Activity Ideas by Age:**
- **0–12 months:** Tummy time, singing, reading, simple toys, face-to-face interaction, exploring textures
- **12–24 months:** Stacking, simple puzzles, scribbling, playground time, pretend play, books, music
- **2–3 years:** Pretend play, art materials, outdoor play, simple games, helping with chores, social play
- **3–5 years:** Complex pretend play, art projects, sports/active play, board games, early literacy activities, building, science exploration
