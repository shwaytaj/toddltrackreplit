## System Architecture

### Frontend Architecture

**Technology Stack:** React 18 with TypeScript, Vite, Wouter (routing), TanStack Query (server state), Tailwind CSS.
**UI Component System:** Radix UI primitives, shadcn/ui (New York style), custom theme with light/dark mode, inspired by leading health/parenting apps.
**Design System:** DM Sans (body), Fredoka (accent), soft lavender palette, custom CSS variables, elevation system.
**State Management:** TanStack Query for server state, session-based for authentication, React Hook Form with Zod for forms.

### Backend Architecture

**Server Framework:** Express.js with TypeScript, session-based authentication using `express-session` and Passport.js (Local Strategy), BCrypt for hashing.
**Session Management:** PostgreSQL-backed sessions using `connect-pg-simple` for production/Autoscale deployments (required for multi-instance session sharing). In-memory store for development.
**API Design:** RESTful endpoints, JSON format, session cookies for authentication.
**Key API Routes:** `/api/auth/*`, `/api/children/*`, `/api/milestones/*`, `/api/children/:id/growth-metrics`, `/api/children/:childId/milestones/:milestoneId/recommendations`.

### Data Storage

**Database:** PostgreSQL via Neon serverless, Drizzle ORM.
**Schema Design:** `users`, `children`, `milestones`, `childMilestones`, `growthMetrics`, `teeth`, `aiRecommendations` and `aiToyRecommendations`. Uses JSONB for flexible medical history and UUIDs for primary keys.
**Data Patterns:** JSONB fields, UUIDs, array fields for parent-child relationships, timestamp tracking.

### Authentication & Authorization

**Authentication Flow:** Email-based authentication using Passport Local Strategy with bcrypt. Session serialization/deserialization by user ID, server-side session storage. Secure cookies (`httpOnly: true`, `sameSite: "lax"`) for production.
**Authorization:** Parent-child relationship verification, session-based user context, query-level access control.

### Key Features and Implementations

**Canonical Milestone System (Nov 2025):** Single source of truth approach using `dev-milestones-comprehensive.md` for all milestone titles. Implemented shared title normalization across all parsers, staged migration preserving child progress (457 canonical + 123 legacy milestones). Database includes `isLegacy` field (NULL-safe filtering treating NULL as false). Validation script ensures cross-file title consistency.
**Simplified Age Calculation (Nov 2025):** Age is now calculated using a simple formula: `Adjusted Age = Current Date - Due Date`. The birthDate field has been completely removed from the application. Only dueDate is stored and used for all age-related calculations including milestone filtering, growth metric percentiles, and AI recommendations. This simplification removed the complex corrected/chronological age logic previously used for premature/post-mature births.
**Multi-Source Milestone Filtering:** Integrates milestone data from 7 international health organizations (CDC/AAP, HSE, WHO, NHS, Australian Dept of Health, Health Canada/CPS, South Africa DoH). Users can select preferred sources in settings. Backend filtering applied to all milestone endpoints (`/api/milestones`, `/api/milestones/age-range`). TanStack Query cache invalidation ensures Home and Milestones pages auto-update when source preferences change. **Database Sync (Nov 2025):** Database synced to use `dev-milestones-comprehensive_1762125221739.md` as the single source of truth (612 canonical milestones: 458 Developmental, 39 Growth, 42 Hearing, 27 Teeth, 46 Vision). Removed 211 non-canonical milestones including WHO growth standards. Created `sync-database-with-comprehensive.ts` script for authoritative sync. Updated source mappings using `milestones-categorised-by-source_1762125221739.md`. Source coverage: 96.3% Developmental, 100% Growth, 90.5% Hearing, 96.3% Teeth, 97.8% Vision. Fixed Postgres text[] array parsing for both milestone sources and user preferences with `parsePostgresArray()` helper. Corrected filtering logic to exclude milestones without sources when user has source preferences (previously included all sourceless milestones). **Detailed Descriptions (Nov 2025):** Loaded 571 detailed milestone descriptions from `milestones-descriptions_1762125221739.md` into database (100% success rate). Created `load-milestone-descriptions.ts` script with enhanced title normalization handling age prefixes, markdown markers, parentheticals, commas, and punctuation variations. Descriptions follow structured format with **About**, **What to look for**, **Why it matters** sections parsed by `milestone-description-parser.ts` and displayed in collapsible sections on MilestoneDetail page. Includes evidence-based content with citations from AAO, WHO, CDC, AAP and other authoritative sources.
**Automatic Milestone Seeding (Nov 2025):** Implemented production-ready automatic milestone seeding via `MilestoneSeeder` service. Runs idempotently on server startup (before routes are registered) to ensure production database always contains all 612 canonical milestones after deployment. Solves Replit Autoscale deployment issue where dev/prod databases are separate and data is not copied during publishing (only schema structure). Seeder checks existing milestone count, skips if already seeded (≥612), otherwise loads from comprehensive file and inserts only missing milestones. Safe failure handling - logs errors but doesn't block server startup. Located in `server/services/milestoneSeeder.ts`, invoked from `server/index.ts`.
**Automatic Description Seeding (Nov 2025):** Implemented production-ready automatic description seeding via `DescriptionSeeder` service. Runs idempotently on server startup (after milestone seeding) to ensure production database always contains rich milestone descriptions. Checks if at least 90% of expected 571 descriptions exist, skips if already loaded, otherwise parses descriptions from `milestones-descriptions_1762125221739.md` and updates database. Matches descriptions to milestones using enhanced title normalization. Safe failure handling - logs errors but doesn't block server startup. Located in `server/services/descriptionSeeder.ts`, invoked from `server/index.ts`.
**AI Recommendations & Caching:** Personalized developmental and toy recommendations generated by Anthropic Claude API, cached in the database (`aiToyRecommendations`) to reduce API calls and improve performance. Cache invalidation based on medical history updates.
**Background Recommendation Warmup (Nov 2025):** Implemented non-blocking background warmup service (`server/services/recommendationWarmup.ts`) that pre-generates AI recommendations for top 5-6 relevant milestones immediately after child onboarding. Runs via `setImmediate` to avoid blocking the API response. Selects milestones closest to the child's adjusted age (±1-2 month window), distributes across categories for variety, skips already-cached recommendations. Cost: ~$0.04 per new child using Claude 3.5 Sonnet. Significantly reduces first-view latency when parents browse milestone details. Triggered from POST `/api/children` route after child creation. **Profile Switch Pre-fetch (Nov 2025):** Extended warmup to trigger when users switch between child profiles via `POST /api/children/:id/warmup` endpoint. Called automatically from `ActiveChildContext.setActiveChildId()` - fire-and-forget pattern ensures no UI blocking. Improves perceived performance when browsing milestones for different children.
**Evidence-Based Citations:** AI recommendations include citations from authoritative pediatric sources (CDC, AAP, WHO, etc.) with URL validation, stored with recommendations, and displayed in the frontend.
**UI/UX Improvements:** Streamlined `MilestoneDetail` page with collapsible "About" section and direct access to "Activities" and "Toys & Tools" tabs.
**Multi-Child Support (Nov 2025):** Implemented global child state management via `ActiveChildProvider` context (`client/src/contexts/ActiveChildContext.tsx`). Features include: seamless child switching across all pages (Home, Milestones, MilestoneDetail, Profile), persistent selection in localStorage, automatic fallback to first child when selected child is deleted, and protection against deleting the last remaining child (server returns 400). Profile page redesigned with child list, add/edit dialogs, and delete confirmation with impact summary. Uses pending selection mechanism with 10-second timeout to prevent race conditions during child creation. All TanStack Query keys include `activeChildId` for proper cache isolation.
**GDPR Compliance (Nov 2025):** Implemented core GDPR features for EU launch. Data Export (`GET /api/user/export`): Downloads ZIP file containing CSV files (account.csv, children.csv, milestones.csv, growth_metrics.csv, teeth.csv, completed_activities.csv) - designed for sharing milestone progress with GPs. Account Deletion (`DELETE /api/user/account`): Password verification required, cascading delete of all children and associated data (milestones, growth metrics, teeth, recommendations), session destruction, and redirect to login. Privacy & Data section added to Profile page with "Download My Data" button and red "Delete My Account" button with confirmation dialog. Uses `archiver` package for ZIP creation.
**Multi-Parent Collaborative Access (Nov 2025):** Implemented role-based parent access system. Schema additions: `parentChildRelationships` table with userId, childId, role (primary/secondary), `invitations` table for 7-day expiring invite tokens. Primary parents (first to onboard a child) have full access including child management (CRUD), parent invitations, and GDPR data export. Secondary parents have view and tracking access (milestones, growth metrics) but cannot modify child profiles or manage other parents. Per-child role enforcement on backend routes prevents privilege escalation (user primary on one child cannot modify children where they are secondary). Profile page UI conditionally hides Add/Edit/Delete child buttons for secondary parents. Invitation flow: primary parent invites via email, token generated with 7-day expiry, secondary parent registers via `/invite/:token` page with token auto-populated. Email service stub ready for Resend integration. Legacy user handling treats users with children but no relationship records as primary for backward compatibility.
**GP Consultation Highlights (Dec 2025):** Implemented contextual highlight cards on Home/Overview page to surface important developmental information at opportune moments. Two types of highlights: (1) **Celebration highlights** (green): Shown when child has ≥80% completion in any category, appearing 15 days before the child ages out of current milestone range. (2) **GP consultation highlights** (amber): Shown when child has <70% completion in Developmental category OR <90% in Teeth/Vision/Hearing categories, timed to appear before pediatric checkups. Uses CDC/AAP 2022 guidelines as basis for thresholds. Shared utility in `shared/highlights.ts` with configurable thresholds. API endpoint `GET /api/children/:childId/highlights` returns highlight data with age range and category progress. `HighlightCard` component renders distinct variants with appropriate icons (PartyPopper for celebration, AlertCircle for GP alerts). Highlights section intentionally hidden when no highlights apply.
